Of course we're no exception, as we still remember the fog shrouded photo we snapped on our first trip to the city way back in the forgotten days of analogue film. More recently some amateur artiste apparently felt that the mythical beasts were lacking a certain je ne sais quoi and took it upon themself to add a smattering of red paint to their mouths and claws.

Small and interesting, but not too exciting at first glance, a longer look at its history and finer details reveals its hidden charm and beauty. Built on the site of a much earlier church, the cathedral’s main structure and appearance dates from the first half of the 18th century. Inside the Baroque masterpiece is a cavalcade of classic creams and golds, littered with extraordinarily detailed frescoes and possessing that calming feeling that only a great church can bring. Of particular interest are the ornate choir stalls and Robba’s maginficent angels on the main altar. Don’t forget to check out the astonishing pair of bronze doors on the western and southern sides. Dating from 1996 and commissioned to celebrate John Paul II’s visit to the Cathedral, the former celebrates 1250 years of Slovenian Christianity, and the latter, depicting six cardinals in a row with the figure of Christ lying at the front, the history of the diocese of the city.","url":"http://lj-stolnica.rkc.si/indexflash-eng.htm","poi_type_id":1,"type_name":"Architecture","lon":"14.508262","lat":"46.050639","visit_duration":60,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/124/thumb_4cf03381-908b-46ee-850e-c72f035c1fd4.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/124/medium_4cf03381-908b-46ee-850e-c72f035c1fd4.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/124/4cf03381-908b-46ee-850e-c72f035c1fd4.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/124/tower_4cf03381-908b-46ee-850e-c72f035c1fd4.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/124/landscape_4cf03381-908b-46ee-850e-c72f035c1fd4.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/124/square_4cf03381-908b-46ee-850e-c72f035c1fd4.jpg","opening_hours":"N/A","tags":[{"tag_id":10,"name":"Church","category_id":1,"depth":1,"collapsed":true},{"tag_id":11,"name":"Cathedral","category_id":1,"depth":1,"collapsed":true}],"details":{"wikipedia":"","facebook":"","twitter":"","youtube":"","instagram":"","pinterest":"","depth":1,"collapsed":true},"address":{"address1":"Dolničarjeva 1","city":"Ljubljana","post_code":"1000","country":"Slovenia","depth":1,"collapsed":true},"contact":{"name":"","email":"lj-stolnica@rkc.si","telephone":"+386 (0) 1234 26 70","fax":"","mobile":"","depth":1,"collapsed":true},"gallery":[{"image":{"id":124,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/124/thumb_4cf03381-908b-46ee-850e-c72f035c1fd4.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/124/medium_4cf03381-908b-46ee-850e-c72f035c1fd4.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/124/4cf03381-908b-46ee-850e-c72f035c1fd4.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/124/tower_4cf03381-908b-46ee-850e-c72f035c1fd4.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/124/landscape_4cf03381-908b-46ee-850e-c72f035c1fd4.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/124/square_4cf03381-908b-46ee-850e-c72f035c1fd4.jpg","description":"","depth":1,"collapsed":true},"depth":1,"collapsed":true}],"depth":1,"collapsed":true},{"id":11,"priority_index":7,"radius":30,"name":"Evangelical Church","description":"Completed in 1852, this fairly unremarkable church represents much that is classic German (or, to be exact, Austrian) austerity.

While it can't compete with some of the much larger and better known zoos in Europe in terms of scale, there's an equally diverse range of animals, and perhaps an even more innovative programme of activities, including at least a few things that we guarantee you won't find anywhere else.","url":"","poi_type_id":3,"type_name":"Cool & Unique","lon":"14.472242","lat":"46.052639","visit_duration":180,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/26/thumb_ee0286cb-e25c-4042-ba2d-80a9d5bf9a0b.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/26/medium_ee0286cb-e25c-4042-ba2d-80a9d5bf9a0b.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/26/ee0286cb-e25c-4042-ba2d-80a9d5bf9a0b.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/26/tower_ee0286cb-e25c-4042-ba2d-80a9d5bf9a0b.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/26/landscape_ee0286cb-e25c-4042-ba2d-80a9d5bf9a0b.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/26/square_ee0286cb-e25c-4042-ba2d-80a9d5bf9a0b.jpg","opening_hours":"N/A","tags":[{"tag_id":13,"name":"Zoo","category_id":3,"depth":1,"collapsed":true}],"details":{"wikipedia":"","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/zoo.si","twitter":"","youtube":"","instagram":"","pinterest":"","depth":1,"collapsed":true},"address":{"address1":"Večna pot 70","city":"Ljubljana","post_code":"1000","country":"Slovenia","depth":1,"collapsed":true},"contact":{"name":"","email":"info@zoo.si","telephone":"+386 1 2442 188","fax":"+386 1 2442 185","mobile":"","depth":1,"collapsed":true},"gallery":[{"image":{"id":26,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/26/thumb_ee0286cb-e25c-4042-ba2d-80a9d5bf9a0b.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/26/medium_ee0286cb-e25c-4042-ba2d-80a9d5bf9a0b.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/26/ee0286cb-e25c-4042-ba2d-80a9d5bf9a0b.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/26/tower_ee0286cb-e25c-4042-ba2d-80a9d5bf9a0b.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/26/landscape_ee0286cb-e25c-4042-ba2d-80a9d5bf9a0b.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/26/square_ee0286cb-e25c-4042-ba2d-80a9d5bf9a0b.jpg","description":"","depth":1,"collapsed":true},"depth":1,"collapsed":true},{"image":{"id":27,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/27/thumb_54b8f203-2cb6-481c-a473-5d264f101403.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/27/medium_54b8f203-2cb6-481c-a473-5d264f101403.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/27/54b8f203-2cb6-481c-a473-5d264f101403.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/27/tower_54b8f203-2cb6-481c-a473-5d264f101403.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/27/landscape_54b8f203-2cb6-481c-a473-5d264f101403.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/27/square_54b8f203-2cb6-481c-a473-5d264f101403.jpg","description":"","depth":1,"collapsed":true},"depth":1,"collapsed":true},{"image":{"id":28,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/28/thumb_bf3c6e58-3efb-4260-8615-1531e097eac0.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/28/medium_bf3c6e58-3efb-4260-8615-1531e097eac0.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/28/bf3c6e58-3efb-4260-8615-1531e097eac0.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/28/tower_bf3c6e58-3efb-4260-8615-1531e097eac0.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/28/landscape_bf3c6e58-3efb-4260-8615-1531e097eac0.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/28/square_bf3c6e58-3efb-4260-8615-1531e097eac0.jpg","description":"","depth":1,"collapsed":true},"depth":1,"collapsed":true},{"image":{"id":29,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/29/thumb_79426669-ed82-4cca-a4fb-8d59a7694dbb.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/29/medium_79426669-ed82-4cca-a4fb-8d59a7694dbb.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/29/79426669-ed82-4cca-a4fb-8d59a7694dbb.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/29/tower_79426669-ed82-4cca-a4fb-8d59a7694dbb.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/29/landscape_79426669-ed82-4cca-a4fb-8d59a7694dbb.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/29/square_79426669-ed82-4cca-a4fb-8d59a7694dbb.jpg","description":"","depth":1,"collapsed":true},"depth":1,"collapsed":true}],"depth":1,"collapsed":true},{"id":18,"priority_index":5,"radius":30,"name":"Path Of Remembrance And Comradeship (\"Pot\")","description":"Also known as the Green Ring or just POT (‘path’ in Slovenian), the Path of Remembrance and Comradeship circles the city, covering some 33km. During World War Two Ljubljana was occupied by the fascist Italian army, and in order to prevent communication between then underground activists in Ljubljana and partisans in the surrounding countryside, a barbed wire fence was erected where the path now stands. Work on the path started immediately following the war, but it wasn’t completed until 1985. Some 7,400 trees now surrounded the gravel-paved route, which is perfect for jogging, walking or cycling. Memorial pillars along it mark the locations of bunkers from the war, and information broads keep the walker informed about what happened here. The closest weekend to May 9th, the date of Ljubljana’s liberation in World War Two, is commemorated with a march along the route, with thousands taking part.","url":"","poi_type_id":3,"type_name":"Cool & Unique","lon":"14.466007","lat":"46.037096","visit_duration":400,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/30/thumb_6c6d1640-b2e9-4556-abf6-5d279827515e.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/30/medium_6c6d1640-b2e9-4556-abf6-5d279827515e.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/30/6c6d1640-b2e9-4556-abf6-5d279827515e.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/30/tower_6c6d1640-b2e9-4556-abf6-5d279827515e.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/30/landscape_6c6d1640-b2e9-4556-abf6-5d279827515e.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/30/square_6c6d1640-b2e9-4556-abf6-5d279827515e.jpg","opening_hours":"N/A","details":{"wikipedia":"","facebook":"","twitter":"","youtube":"","instagram":"","pinterest":"","depth":1,"collapsed":true},"address":{"address1":"","city":"","post_code":"","country":"Slovenia","depth":1,"collapsed":true},"contact":{"name":"","email":"","telephone":"","fax":"","mobile":"","depth":1,"collapsed":true},"gallery":[{"image":{"id":30,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/30/thumb_6c6d1640-b2e9-4556-abf6-5d279827515e.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/30/medium_6c6d1640-b2e9-4556-abf6-5d279827515e.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/30/6c6d1640-b2e9-4556-abf6-5d279827515e.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/30/tower_6c6d1640-b2e9-4556-abf6-5d279827515e.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/30/landscape_6c6d1640-b2e9-4556-abf6-5d279827515e.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/30/square_6c6d1640-b2e9-4556-abf6-5d279827515e.jpg","description":"","depth":1,"collapsed":true},"depth":1,"collapsed":true},{"image":{"id":31,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/31/thumb_c0b26940-5b6b-4586-bbd8-51b46577c860.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/31/medium_c0b26940-5b6b-4586-bbd8-51b46577c860.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/31/c0b26940-5b6b-4586-bbd8-51b46577c860.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/31/tower_c0b26940-5b6b-4586-bbd8-51b46577c860.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/31/landscape_c0b26940-5b6b-4586-bbd8-51b46577c860.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/31/square_c0b26940-5b6b-4586-bbd8-51b46577c860.jpg","description":"","depth":1,"collapsed":true},"depth":1,"collapsed":true},{"image":{"id":32,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/32/thumb_00dce053-1790-4f1e-9ee3-a5889dbf7808.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/32/medium_00dce053-1790-4f1e-9ee3-a5889dbf7808.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/32/00dce053-1790-4f1e-9ee3-a5889dbf7808.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/32/tower_00dce053-1790-4f1e-9ee3-a5889dbf7808.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/32/landscape_00dce053-1790-4f1e-9ee3-a5889dbf7808.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/32/square_00dce053-1790-4f1e-9ee3-a5889dbf7808.jpg","description":"","depth":1,"collapsed":true},"depth":1,"collapsed":true}],"depth":1,"collapsed":true},{"id":19,"priority_index":5,"radius":30,"name":"Botanical Gardens","description":"Nearly 200 years old, this garden is part of the biology department of Ljubljana University and has 2 hectares of protected landscape, with over 4500 species of native and foreign plants.

Due to the quality and unique design of Rogaška's masterpieces, the workshop received a Five Star Diamond Award twice – in 2007 and in 2008 – awarded by The American Academy of Hospitality Sciences.","url":"http://www.steklarna-rogaska.si/en","poi_type_id":8,"type_name":"Shopping","lon":"14.506435","lat":"46.049637","visit_duration":30,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/69/thumb_fa98d209-4f85-4501-a6ba-c41b7afe3b2c.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/69/medium_fa98d209-4f85-4501-a6ba-c41b7afe3b2c.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/69/fa98d209-4f85-4501-a6ba-c41b7afe3b2c.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/69/tower_fa98d209-4f85-4501-a6ba-c41b7afe3b2c.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/69/landscape_fa98d209-4f85-4501-a6ba-c41b7afe3b2c.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/69/square_fa98d209-4f85-4501-a6ba-c41b7afe3b2c.jpg","opening_hours":"Wed 09:00-20:00","details":{"wikipedia":"","facebook":"","twitter":"","youtube":"","instagram":"","pinterest":"","depth":1,"collapsed":true},"address":{"address1":"Mestni trg 22","city":"Ljubljana","post_code":"1000","country":"Slovenia","depth":1,"collapsed":true},"contact":{"name":"","email":"prodajalna.ljubljana@stek-rogaska.si","telephone":"+386 (0)1 24 12 701","fax":"","mobile":"","depth":1,"collapsed":true},"gallery":[{"image":{"id":69,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/69/thumb_fa98d209-4f85-4501-a6ba-c41b7afe3b2c.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/69/medium_fa98d209-4f85-4501-a6ba-c41b7afe3b2c.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/69/fa98d209-4f85-4501-a6ba-c41b7afe3b2c.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/69/tower_fa98d209-4f85-4501-a6ba-c41b7afe3b2c.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/69/landscape_fa98d209-4f85-4501-a6ba-c41b7afe3b2c.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/69/square_fa98d209-4f85-4501-a6ba-c41b7afe3b2c.jpg","description":"","depth":1,"collapsed":true},"depth":1,"collapsed":true},{"image":{"id":70,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/70/thumb_3d41ffef-8729-4971-b7ae-47e6dd0bbaca.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/70/medium_3d41ffef-8729-4971-b7ae-47e6dd0bbaca.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/70/3d41ffef-8729-4971-b7ae-47e6dd0bbaca.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/70/tower_3d41ffef-8729-4971-b7ae-47e6dd0bbaca.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/70/landscape_3d41ffef-8729-4971-b7ae-47e6dd0bbaca.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/70/square_3d41ffef-8729-4971-b7ae-47e6dd0bbaca.jpg","description":"","depth":1,"collapsed":true},"depth":1,"collapsed":true}],"depth":1,"collapsed":true},{"id":36,"priority_index":3,"radius":15,"name":"Marjeta Grošelj Handbags","description":"Marjeta Grošelj has been creating handbags for over four decades.

It is located in the very city centre and covers the area between the Triple Bridge and the Dragon Bridge. The market areas are located at the Vodnikov trg Square, Pogačarjev trg Square and Dolničarjeva ulica Street, while trading is also carried out at the Plečnik’s Arcades and in the indoor market (the theological seminary building). The market operates with its own routine cycles: weekly, monthly, yearly and, most importantly, daily. Every morning retailers fill the market with various goods placed on view at booths and stalls, trading carts, display cases, kiosks, etc. The Central Market has its charm in every season. In the first days of spring, the market offers the first vegetables and flowers. In the summer, when visitors buy fresh fruits and vegetables, they like to rest in the shade and cool down with a drink. In the autumn people like to buy goods for winter storage.

Hotel CUBO is housed in a historic, protected building that has been enriched with a fresh, modern design to create an impressive contrast. We have always been aware of the fact that an excellent location, spacious rooms and select furnishings represent only a part of what a superior hotel must offer its guests. At CUBO, service comes first, and this is why we focus intensively on staff and their willingness to perform with excellence, dedication and heart, all the while welcoming our guests as if they have just arrived to our staff members’ own homes.

The building was also connected to a sewage system: waste water left the building through small drains covered by stones into a larger collection sewage drain (sewer) flowing below the nearby road and leading to the Ljubljanica River.</p>","url":"http://www.mgml.si/en/city-museum-of-ljubljana-377/archaeological-park-emona/","poi_type_id":1,"type_name":"Architecture","lon":"14.50124405","lat":"46.04505299","visit_duration":60,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/136/thumb_1fd71cde-cfa0-438a-978d-91ba6696731f.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/136/medium_1fd71cde-cfa0-438a-978d-91ba6696731f.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/136/1fd71cde-cfa0-438a-978d-91ba6696731f.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/136/tower_1fd71cde-cfa0-438a-978d-91ba6696731f.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/136/landscape_1fd71cde-cfa0-438a-978d-91ba6696731f.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/136/square_1fd71cde-cfa0-438a-978d-91ba6696731f.jpg","opening_hours":"N/A","details":{"wikipedia":"","facebook":"","twitter":"","youtube":"","instagram":"","pinterest":"","depth":1,"collapsed":true},"address":{"address1":"Mirje 4","city":"Ljubljana","post_code":"1000","country":"Slovenia","depth":1,"collapsed":true},"contact":{"name":"","email":"","telephone":"","fax":"","mobile":"","depth":1,"collapsed":true},"gallery":[{"image":{"id":136,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/136/thumb_1fd71cde-cfa0-438a-978d-91ba6696731f.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/136/medium_1fd71cde-cfa0-438a-978d-91ba6696731f.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/136/1fd71cde-cfa0-438a-978d-91ba6696731f.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/136/tower_1fd71cde-cfa0-438a-978d-91ba6696731f.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/136/landscape_1fd71cde-cfa0-438a-978d-91ba6696731f.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/136/square_1fd71cde-cfa0-438a-978d-91ba6696731f.jpg","description":"","depth":1,"collapsed":true},"depth":1,"collapsed":true},{"image":{"id":137,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/137/thumb_74287bc8-35e0-423f-b6d8-de816bb8ca09.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/137/medium_74287bc8-35e0-423f-b6d8-de816bb8ca09.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/137/74287bc8-35e0-423f-b6d8-de816bb8ca09.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/137/tower_74287bc8-35e0-423f-b6d8-de816bb8ca09.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/137/landscape_74287bc8-35e0-423f-b6d8-de816bb8ca09.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/137/square_74287bc8-35e0-423f-b6d8-de816bb8ca09.jpg","description":"","depth":1,"collapsed":true},"depth":1,"collapsed":true},{"image":{"id":138,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/138/thumb_a2587ae1-0692-467e-a9b9-db6d939abe9f.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/138/medium_a2587ae1-0692-467e-a9b9-db6d939abe9f.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/138/a2587ae1-0692-467e-a9b9-db6d939abe9f.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/138/tower_a2587ae1-0692-467e-a9b9-db6d939abe9f.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/138/landscape_a2587ae1-0692-467e-a9b9-db6d939abe9f.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/138/square_a2587ae1-0692-467e-a9b9-db6d939abe9f.jpg","description":"","depth":1,"collapsed":true},"depth":1,"collapsed":true}],"depth":1,"collapsed":true},{"id":92,"priority_index":5,"radius":40,"name":"National University Library","description":"Known to locals by its Slovene acronym NUK, the library was originally established by Empress Maria Theresa in 1774 and moved to its current Plečnik designed building in 1941.

Formerly known as St Christopher's Cemetery, from the early 1700s until the construction of the much larger Žale in 1936, it served as the primary destination for the city's recently departed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A plan to transform the area into a grand memorial park, and move the tombs of some of many prominent Slovenes there, was championed by famous Slovene architect Jože Plečnik and his student at the time Edvard Ravnikar. While a small neoclassical arcade was initially built and quite a few tombs were in fact relocated, the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia indefinitely postponed the plans, which were then abandoned altogether in the years following the war.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After decades of neglect, the cemetery was finally renovated in the early 1990s, and nowadays the long, narrow, tree-filled space is squeezed between a newly built park and some nondescript commercial buildings. But concealed behind it's walls are the final resting places of some notable Slovenes, including Linhart, Vodnik, Čop, Levstik, Stritar and Aškerc - all of which should sound familiar even to non-historians who have paid attention to the place names on a map of Ljubljana. The entrance to the Navje is on Vilharjeva Cesta, just across the street from where the passageway under the the train station emerges.</p>","url":"","poi_type_id":1,"type_name":"Architecture","lon":"14.51196532","lat":"46.06032629","visit_duration":30,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/148/thumb_ecada84a-d4c9-4b86-abea-0044c63d60a7.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/148/medium_ecada84a-d4c9-4b86-abea-0044c63d60a7.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/148/ecada84a-d4c9-4b86-abea-0044c63d60a7.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/148/tower_ecada84a-d4c9-4b86-abea-0044c63d60a7.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/148/landscape_ecada84a-d4c9-4b86-abea-0044c63d60a7.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/148/square_ecada84a-d4c9-4b86-abea-0044c63d60a7.jpg","opening_hours":"N/A","tags":[{"tag_id":31,"name":"Cemetery","category_id":1,"depth":1,"collapsed":true}],"details":{"wikipedia":"","facebook":"","twitter":"","youtube":"","instagram":"","pinterest":"","depth":1,"collapsed":true},"address":{"address1":"","city":"","post_code":"","country":"Slovenia","depth":1,"collapsed":true},"contact":{"name":"","email":"","telephone":"","fax":"","mobile":"","depth":1,"collapsed":true},"gallery":[{"image":{"id":148,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/148/thumb_ecada84a-d4c9-4b86-abea-0044c63d60a7.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/148/medium_ecada84a-d4c9-4b86-abea-0044c63d60a7.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/148/ecada84a-d4c9-4b86-abea-0044c63d60a7.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/148/tower_ecada84a-d4c9-4b86-abea-0044c63d60a7.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/148/landscape_ecada84a-d4c9-4b86-abea-0044c63d60a7.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/148/square_ecada84a-d4c9-4b86-abea-0044c63d60a7.jpg","description":"","depth":1,"collapsed":true},"depth":1,"collapsed":true},{"image":{"id":149,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/149/thumb_e0cc5375-2db0-4e06-823a-22ab82f4b93a.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/149/medium_e0cc5375-2db0-4e06-823a-22ab82f4b93a.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/149/e0cc5375-2db0-4e06-823a-22ab82f4b93a.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/149/tower_e0cc5375-2db0-4e06-823a-22ab82f4b93a.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/149/landscape_e0cc5375-2db0-4e06-823a-22ab82f4b93a.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/149/square_e0cc5375-2db0-4e06-823a-22ab82f4b93a.jpg","description":"","depth":1,"collapsed":true},"depth":1,"collapsed":true}],"depth":1,"collapsed":true},{"id":96,"priority_index":5,"radius":50,"name":"Žale Cemetery","description":"Built on the site of a much earlier cemetery attached to the neighbouring (and still standing) Holy Cross Church, what’s arguably Plečnik’s Ljubljana masterpiece was completed in 1940. The grand arched entrance complete with stark white colonnades supposedly represents the gateway between the lands of the living and the dead. Between them and the cemetery itself are a series of peculiar buildings, chapels and monuments including the Žale funeral home. Architectural styles abound, reflecting Plečnik’s vision of equality among religions. The cemetery itself, once you get there, is a pleasure to behold and is worthy of a good hour’s stroll. The final resting place of many Slovenian greats including Plečnik himself, Žale also contains a small area given over to the Jewish population of the city.","url":"http://www.zale.si/en/","poi_type_id":1,"type_name":"Architecture","lon":"14.52807928","lat":"46.06761929","visit_duration":60,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/150/thumb_53758553-248c-48ee-ae51-15fdb18ecdbc.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/150/medium_53758553-248c-48ee-ae51-15fdb18ecdbc.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/150/53758553-248c-48ee-ae51-15fdb18ecdbc.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/150/tower_53758553-248c-48ee-ae51-15fdb18ecdbc.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/150/landscape_53758553-248c-48ee-ae51-15fdb18ecdbc.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/150/square_53758553-248c-48ee-ae51-15fdb18ecdbc.jpg","opening_hours":"N/A","tags":[{"tag_id":31,"name":"Cemetery","category_id":1,"depth":1,"collapsed":true}],"details":{"wikipedia":"","facebook":"","twitter":"","youtube":"","instagram":"","pinterest":"","depth":1,"collapsed":true},"address":{"address1":"Med hmeljniki 2","city":"Ljubljana","post_code":"1000","country":"Slovenia","depth":1,"collapsed":true},"contact":{"name":"","email":"info@zale.si","telephone":"+386 1 420 17 00","fax":"","mobile":"+386 1 420 17 02","depth":1,"collapsed":true},"gallery":[{"image":{"id":150,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/150/thumb_53758553-248c-48ee-ae51-15fdb18ecdbc.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/150/medium_53758553-248c-48ee-ae51-15fdb18ecdbc.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/150/53758553-248c-48ee-ae51-15fdb18ecdbc.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/150/tower_53758553-248c-48ee-ae51-15fdb18ecdbc.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/150/landscape_53758553-248c-48ee-ae51-15fdb18ecdbc.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/150/square_53758553-248c-48ee-ae51-15fdb18ecdbc.jpg","description":"","depth":1,"collapsed":true},"depth":1,"collapsed":true},{"image":{"id":151,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/151/thumb_cdbdc873-71cb-4ba8-b21b-4ca3ca9ab0ab.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/151/medium_cdbdc873-71cb-4ba8-b21b-4ca3ca9ab0ab.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/151/cdbdc873-71cb-4ba8-b21b-4ca3ca9ab0ab.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/151/tower_cdbdc873-71cb-4ba8-b21b-4ca3ca9ab0ab.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/151/landscape_cdbdc873-71cb-4ba8-b21b-4ca3ca9ab0ab.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/151/square_cdbdc873-71cb-4ba8-b21b-4ca3ca9ab0ab.jpg","description":"","depth":1,"collapsed":true},"depth":1,"collapsed":true},{"image":{"id":152,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/152/thumb_af396b3e-a9db-4345-84e2-46362bdd8aef.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/152/medium_af396b3e-a9db-4345-84e2-46362bdd8aef.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/152/af396b3e-a9db-4345-84e2-46362bdd8aef.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/152/tower_af396b3e-a9db-4345-84e2-46362bdd8aef.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/152/landscape_af396b3e-a9db-4345-84e2-46362bdd8aef.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/152/square_af396b3e-a9db-4345-84e2-46362bdd8aef.jpg","description":"","depth":1,"collapsed":true},"depth":1,"collapsed":true}],"depth":1,"collapsed":true},{"id":97,"priority_index":3,"radius":30,"name":"Atlantis Water Park","description":"Located where else but in BTC City, Atlantis is arguably the top destination for water-based entertainment and fun in Ljubljana.

Hall","description":"<p>Ljubljana's Town Hall (locally referred to as Mestna hiša, Magistrat or Rotovž), is used as the seat of the Municipality of Ljubljana. It was built in the late 15th century by the master builder Peter Bezlaj. It assumed its present appearance between 1717 and 1719, when an annexe designed by Carlo Martinuzzi was added to it by the master builder Gregor Maček Snr. Later the building was alterated several times, the most thoroughly by the architect Svetozar Križaj in 1963.</p><p>The Town Hall façade reflects Venetian architectural influences. The vestibule provides space for a late Gothic plaque with a coat of arms surviving from the original Town Hall building and a 17th century statue of Hercules with a lion, previously a part of the Hercules Fountain which used to stand in the middle of the nearby Stari trg square. In the Town Hall's arched courtyard stands Francesco Robba's Narcissus Fountain (Narcisov vodnjak) from Bokalce Castle (Grad Bokalce). Next to the staircase there is a monument in memory of Ivan Hribar (1851-1941), a famous mayor of Ljubljana.</p><p><b>Exhibitions in the Town Hall</b></p>Ljubljana Town Hall features four exhibition spaces: the Glass Atrium, the Historical Atrium, the Central and Right Atriums. The primary purpose of the exhibition space is to showcase projects by the Municipality of Ljubljana. Also on display are exhibitions organized through international and inter-city partnerships, individual and group exhibitions of fine art by established and amateur artists.</p>","url":"http://www.ljubljana.si/en/","poi_type_id":1,"type_name":"Architecture","lon":"14.5068163","lat":"46.04994895","visit_duration":60,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/227/thumb_a0328476-a8e9-4bdd-86ab-db743fe61e9d.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/227/medium_a0328476-a8e9-4bdd-86ab-db743fe61e9d.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/227/a0328476-a8e9-4bdd-86ab-db743fe61e9d.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/227/tower_a0328476-a8e9-4bdd-86ab-db743fe61e9d.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/227/landscape_a0328476-a8e9-4bdd-86ab-db743fe61e9d.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/227/square_a0328476-a8e9-4bdd-86ab-db743fe61e9d.jpg","opening_hours":"N/A","details":{"wikipedia":"https://sl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mestna_hi%C5%A1a,_Ljubljana","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Mestna-Hisa-Ljubljana/232893883438516","twitter":"","youtube":"","instagram":"","pinterest":"","depth":1,"collapsed":true},"address":{"address1":"Mestni trg 1 ","city":"Ljubljana","post_code":"1000","country":"Slovenia","depth":1,"collapsed":true},"contact":{"name":"","email":"galerija@ljubljana.si","telephone":"+386 (0)1 306 11 71","fax":"","mobile":"","depth":1,"collapsed":true},"gallery":[{"image":{"id":227,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/227/thumb_a0328476-a8e9-4bdd-86ab-db743fe61e9d.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/227/medium_a0328476-a8e9-4bdd-86ab-db743fe61e9d.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/227/a0328476-a8e9-4bdd-86ab-db743fe61e9d.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/227/tower_a0328476-a8e9-4bdd-86ab-db743fe61e9d.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/227/landscape_a0328476-a8e9-4bdd-86ab-db743fe61e9d.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/227/square_a0328476-a8e9-4bdd-86ab-db743fe61e9d.jpg","description":"","depth":1,"collapsed":true},"depth":1,"collapsed":true},{"image":{"id":228,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/228/thumb_012195f8-f436-42ca-8524-3f68a5656b27.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/228/medium_012195f8-f436-42ca-8524-3f68a5656b27.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/228/012195f8-f436-42ca-8524-3f68a5656b27.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/228/tower_012195f8-f436-42ca-8524-3f68a5656b27.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/228/landscape_012195f8-f436-42ca-8524-3f68a5656b27.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/228/square_012195f8-f436-42ca-8524-3f68a5656b27.jpg","description":"","depth":1,"collapsed":true},"depth":1,"collapsed":true}],"depth":1,"collapsed":true},null,{"id":119,"priority_index":5,"radius":30,"name":"Križanke","description":"<p>The Križanke Outdoor Theatre (Poletno gledališče Križanke) is a theatre in Ljubljana, Slovenia, used for summer festivals set up inside the courtyard of the former Monastery of the Holy Cross.[1] It is located at French Revolution Square (Trg francoske revolucije) no. 1.</p><p>It was created by Jože Plečnik in the 1950s within the confiscated former monastery especially for the Ljubljana Festival.

For it he sacrificed the Ursuline garden, the green area that had provided the largest garden in Ljubljana from the middle of the 17th century on.  The point of departure of the architecture are two thick towers with a triangular profile, set on an elevated platform. They were designed as higher towers, symbolically set on the north wall of the Roman Emona. With the towers, Ravnikar designed a new city gate between Rožnik and Castle Hill. The economic reform in 1965 stopped the impetus. Only 12 basic floors were built and the towers were concluded with different sized crowns layered with copper tin plate. The smaller one became the seat of Ljubljanska banka, the larger one, Iskra. In 1975 the west side of the square was decorated with a monument of revolution and in 1981 with a monument to the politician Edvard Kardelj.</p><p>The trading house which closes off the square by the Ursuline monastery is a piece of quality functionalistic architecture. The architect did not exaggerate in forcing the height of the building. He extended the edifice by the monastery and with that he separated the Baroque part from the new square. The store was connected by a covered basement passageway and garage.</p><p>The square's last large building is the Ivan Cankar Cultural Centre, built and fitted between 1976 and 1984. There are several halls in it; the largest concert hall with about 1500 seats is named after the composer Jakobus Gallus, and a smaller one after the dramatist Anton Tomaž Linhart. There is a smaller gallery in the centre, several exhibition areas and a restaurant. The basic arrangement of the large entrance hall imitates the cathedral in Assisi.</p>\r\n","url":"http://www.slovenia.info/en/Architectural-Heritage/Ljubljana,-Republic-Square-(Trg-republike).htm?arhitekturne_znamenitosti=846&lng=2&redirected=1","poi_type_id":3,"type_name":"Cool & Unique","lon":"14.49986199","lat":"46.05093945","visit_duration":15,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/234/thumb_82f78dde-2999-4dac-9ca2-e1781ca7d167.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/234/medium_82f78dde-2999-4dac-9ca2-e1781ca7d167.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/234/82f78dde-2999-4dac-9ca2-e1781ca7d167.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/234/tower_82f78dde-2999-4dac-9ca2-e1781ca7d167.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/234/landscape_82f78dde-2999-4dac-9ca2-e1781ca7d167.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/234/square_82f78dde-2999-4dac-9ca2-e1781ca7d167.jpg","opening_hours":"N/A","tags":[{"tag_id":9,"name":"Square","category_id":1,"depth":1,"collapsed":true}],"details":{"wikipedia":"","facebook":"","twitter":"","youtube":"","instagram":"","pinterest":"","depth":1,"collapsed":true},"address":{"address1":"Trg republike","city":"Ljubljana","post_code":"1000","country":"Slovenia","depth":1,"collapsed":true},"contact":{"name":"","email":"","telephone":"","fax":"","mobile":"","depth":1,"collapsed":true},"gallery":[{"image":{"id":234,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/234/thumb_82f78dde-2999-4dac-9ca2-e1781ca7d167.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/234/medium_82f78dde-2999-4dac-9ca2-e1781ca7d167.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/234/82f78dde-2999-4dac-9ca2-e1781ca7d167.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/234/tower_82f78dde-2999-4dac-9ca2-e1781ca7d167.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/234/landscape_82f78dde-2999-4dac-9ca2-e1781ca7d167.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/234/square_82f78dde-2999-4dac-9ca2-e1781ca7d167.jpg","description":"","depth":1,"collapsed":true},"depth":1,"collapsed":true},{"image":{"id":235,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/235/thumb_9ae278a9-22f0-4882-956e-39ee85500344.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/235/medium_9ae278a9-22f0-4882-956e-39ee85500344.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/235/9ae278a9-22f0-4882-956e-39ee85500344.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/235/tower_9ae278a9-22f0-4882-956e-39ee85500344.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/235/landscape_9ae278a9-22f0-4882-956e-39ee85500344.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/235/square_9ae278a9-22f0-4882-956e-39ee85500344.jpg","description":"","depth":1,"collapsed":true},"depth":1,"collapsed":true}],"depth":1,"collapsed":true},null,{"id":122,"priority_index":3,"radius":30,"name":"Ljubljana Exhibition And Convention Centre","description":"<p>The Exhibition and Convention Centre (Slovene: Gospodarsko razstavišče) in Ljubljana is a venue for organising domestic and international fairs as well as other events.

The Stanovsko Theatre had a strong German orientation and most of its actors were of German origin. The best seats and boxes were in the permanent possession of Ljubljana’s Nabob and nobility. Such a theatre was certainly not agreeable to progressive Slovenians. However, domestic performances were rare and thus theatre goers had little choice but to visit German plays.</p><p>Then something unthinkable happened. It was on 17 February 1887, at half past midnight: “Fire! Feuer!”</p><p>The fateful fire completely ruined the building – it was razed to the ground. Profound mourning among theatre lovers … many tears… extensive material damage … but … maybe finally now …?</p><p>“Even God himself could not tolerate the injustice that Slovenian people have been subjected to - he has unleashed fire upon the old theatre.”</p><p>In these words, which came straight from the heart of theatre historian, Anton Trstenjak, a ray of hope could be heard. Perhaps at last the time was right for a new theatre, a theatre where the local population would have more rights.</p><p>The foundations for the new theatre were laid soon after the fire – today’s Slovenian National Theatre Drama Ljubljana. On the site of the fire, just few years later, a new building appeared – the so-called Tonhalle.</p><p>The date of 25 October 1891 was marked by music. All over Ljubljana solemn concerts were held, and at the central concert Liszt’s Piano concerto was performed.</p><p>We can only imagine how enchanted the visitors were, admiring the miraculous Great Hall for first time, with its frescoes painted by H. Wettach, an extremely popular artist of the time.

The terminal building (T1) was extended with a new upper level added to it and completely renovated; the floor that was added on top of the departure lounge added an additional 4,000 m2 (43,000 sq ft), and four jetways have also been installed so that passengers have easier access to the terminal and aircraft. A walkway to the second terminal building (T2) will be added after the T2 terminal is approved. With completion of the work on T1, the airport gained extra floor area, which in the short term will ensure the separation of Schengen and non-Schengen traffic.</p>","url":"http://www.lju-airport.si/en/Main","poi_type_id":6,"type_name":"Public Transport","lon":"14.45515255","lat":"46.23101997","visit_duration":90,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/281/thumb_c8ebcdf0-4092-4856-b471-ae3bdbdf63b9.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/281/medium_c8ebcdf0-4092-4856-b471-ae3bdbdf63b9.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/281/c8ebcdf0-4092-4856-b471-ae3bdbdf63b9.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/281/tower_c8ebcdf0-4092-4856-b471-ae3bdbdf63b9.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/281/landscape_c8ebcdf0-4092-4856-b471-ae3bdbdf63b9.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/281/square_c8ebcdf0-4092-4856-b471-ae3bdbdf63b9.jpg","opening_hours":"N/A","details":{"wikipedia":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ljubljana_Jo%C5%BEe_Pu%C4%8Dnik_Airport","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/Letalisce-Jozeta-Pucnika-525628570828582/?fref=ts","twitter":"","youtube":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRVxPhL_wD_P1JAKVS3d-xw","instagram":"","pinterest":"","depth":1,"collapsed":true},"address":{"address1":"Zgornji Brnik 130a","city":"Brnik","post_code":"4210","country":"Slovenia","depth":1,"collapsed":true},"contact":{"name":"","email":"info@lju-airport.si","telephone":" +386 (0)4 20 61 981","fax":"","mobile":"","depth":1,"collapsed":true},"gallery":[{"image":{"id":281,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/281/thumb_c8ebcdf0-4092-4856-b471-ae3bdbdf63b9.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/281/medium_c8ebcdf0-4092-4856-b471-ae3bdbdf63b9.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/281/c8ebcdf0-4092-4856-b471-ae3bdbdf63b9.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/281/tower_c8ebcdf0-4092-4856-b471-ae3bdbdf63b9.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/281/landscape_c8ebcdf0-4092-4856-b471-ae3bdbdf63b9.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/281/square_c8ebcdf0-4092-4856-b471-ae3bdbdf63b9.jpg","description":"","depth":1,"collapsed":true},"depth":1,"collapsed":true},{"image":{"id":282,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/282/thumb_4202d727-3e6e-41d2-a67f-fbed87e42782.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/282/medium_4202d727-3e6e-41d2-a67f-fbed87e42782.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/282/4202d727-3e6e-41d2-a67f-fbed87e42782.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/282/tower_4202d727-3e6e-41d2-a67f-fbed87e42782.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/282/landscape_4202d727-3e6e-41d2-a67f-fbed87e42782.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/282/square_4202d727-3e6e-41d2-a67f-fbed87e42782.jpg","description":"","depth":1,"collapsed":true},"depth":1,"collapsed":true},{"image":{"id":283,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/283/thumb_19cfd756-0a2a-4169-93c4-fc0cf3c27a15.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/283/medium_19cfd756-0a2a-4169-93c4-fc0cf3c27a15.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/283/19cfd756-0a2a-4169-93c4-fc0cf3c27a15.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/283/tower_19cfd756-0a2a-4169-93c4-fc0cf3c27a15.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/283/landscape_19cfd756-0a2a-4169-93c4-fc0cf3c27a15.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/283/square_19cfd756-0a2a-4169-93c4-fc0cf3c27a15.jpg","description":"","depth":1,"collapsed":true},"depth":1,"collapsed":true},{"image":{"id":284,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/284/thumb_0c545327-c722-4178-9eac-cd7addd11e3b.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/284/medium_0c545327-c722-4178-9eac-cd7addd11e3b.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/284/0c545327-c722-4178-9eac-cd7addd11e3b.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/284/tower_0c545327-c722-4178-9eac-cd7addd11e3b.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/284/landscape_0c545327-c722-4178-9eac-cd7addd11e3b.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/284/square_0c545327-c722-4178-9eac-cd7addd11e3b.jpg","description":"","depth":1,"collapsed":true},"depth":1,"collapsed":true}],"depth":1,"collapsed":true},{"id":134,"priority_index":5,"radius":20,"name":"City Museum Of Ljubljana","description":"<p<The City Museum of Ljubljana is situated in Auersperg Palace, which in itself is an architectural monument, and holds Ljubljana’s cultural heritage of several millennia. This ranges from the 4,500-year-old prehistoric pile dwelling settlement to the present-day charming capital of Slovenia, from the ancient town to the emergence of the modern economic, political, administrative and creative centre.</p><p><b>About Auersperg Palace</b></p><p>Auersperg Palace and the location where the Museum is situated represent a significant part of Ljubljana’s cultural heritage.</p><p>In the Roman period, this was where port suburbs of the Roman Emona stretched, as evidenced by the Roman road preserved in the Museum’s basement.</p><p>The Palace was rebuilt in 1654 by the Counts of Auersperg, who were one of the most prominent noble houses of Carniola, from their own house and two additional houses in just four years. The three tracts encompassed a newly arranged courtyard in the centre of which a stone fountain and a linden tree were situated. The Counts mainly lived here during winter, whilst they spent the summer at Turjak Castle. Their prominence in the life of the city is also evidenced by the fact that the Austrian Emperor Joseph II paid them a visit.</p><p>The Palace was soon subject to the first Baroque alterations, and in 1824 master builder Francesco Cocconi provided its front with a late Baroque façade, emphasising it by means of a Classicist portal. Auersperg Palace was badly affected by the 1895 earthquake. In 1927, the Palace was sold to the state.</p><p>In mid-1935, the Palace was bought by the Municipality of Ljubljana and allocated to the City Museum for the purpose of “collecting all objects relating to the history of Ljubljana, i.e. with regard to both Ljubljana’s role in spiritual and national terms and to the development of present-day Ljubljana”. The refurbishment of interior spaces was undertaken in April 1937. That same year saw the opening of the first museum collection which provided an insight into the middle-class residential culture from the late Middle Ages to the first half of the 19th century.</p><p>After World War Two, Auersperg Palace was also home to the Slovanska knjižnica library, the Municipal Archives of Ljubljana, the Education and Culture Board of the Municipal People’s Administration, the cloakrooms of the Ljubljana City Theatre, and several private residents.</p><p>The 1990s in the City Museum were particularly influenced by the Towards a Friendly Museum project in which the Museum started to open up to the public and its building started to be renovated. As a result, a new floor area of 1,000 m2 was acquired, the building was provided with a basement and, consequently, extensive archaeological research was undertaken and significant findings were recorded. The project was concluded with the Curve architecture competition project, undertaken as a comprehensive renovation of the premises in terms of construction, seismic safety and function. The internationally awarded project designed by the architects Špela Videčnik and Rok Oman succeeded in approaching the Museum’s mission to the highest degree possible, i.e. to make Auersperg Palace available to public programmes and, along with that, to harmonise the ancient palace with the Museum’s dynamic activity, thereby reaching the widest possible audience as well as other users.</p><p><b>About the Museum</b></p><p>The mission of the City Museum of Ljubljana is to record, document, conserve, study and present the movable cultural heritage as regards the Ljubljana region. Its collection comprises over 200,000 museum objects accounting for several millennia of the Ljubljana region’s heritage. Special mention is to be made of two findings, i.e. the world’s oldest wooden wheel with a wooden axle and a wooden point around 40,000 years old.</p><p>You can visit the City Museum of Ljubljana to view our interactive and thematically designed permanent exhibition about the history of Ljubljana and its inhabitants, or you can visit us in order to see the current temporary exhibitions.</p><p>The Museum functions as a meeting point for visitors to various events intended for adults, families or school groups. Lectures, round-table discussions, projections, guided tours, workshops, training courses, concerts and other events are designed to meet the various needs and wishes of our visitors.</b>","url":"http://www.mgml.si/en/city-museum-of-ljubljana-377/","poi_type_id":2,"type_name":"Art & Museums","lon":"14.50393913","lat":"46.04693841","visit_duration":60,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/285/thumb_127ca141-4156-4c18-b3f9-5e14d64747ab.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/285/medium_127ca141-4156-4c18-b3f9-5e14d64747ab.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/285/127ca141-4156-4c18-b3f9-5e14d64747ab.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/285/tower_127ca141-4156-4c18-b3f9-5e14d64747ab.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/285/landscape_127ca141-4156-4c18-b3f9-5e14d64747ab.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/285/square_127ca141-4156-4c18-b3f9-5e14d64747ab.jpg","opening_hours":"N/A","details":{"wikipedia":"","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Muzej-in-galerije-mesta-Ljubljane/123191654959","twitter":"","youtube":"","instagram":"","pinterest":"","depth":1,"collapsed":true},"address":{"address1":"Gosposka 15","city":"Ljubljana","post_code":"1000","country":"Slovenia","depth":1,"collapsed":true},"contact":{"name":"","email":"prijava@mgml.si","telephone":"01 2412 500","fax":"","mobile":"","depth":1,"collapsed":true},"gallery":[{"image":{"id":285,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/285/thumb_127ca141-4156-4c18-b3f9-5e14d64747ab.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/285/medium_127ca141-4156-4c18-b3f9-5e14d64747ab.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/285/127ca141-4156-4c18-b3f9-5e14d64747ab.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/285/tower_127ca141-4156-4c18-b3f9-5e14d64747ab.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/285/landscape_127ca141-4156-4c18-b3f9-5e14d64747ab.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/285/square_127ca141-4156-4c18-b3f9-5e14d64747ab.jpg","description":"","depth":1,"collapsed":true},"depth":1,"collapsed":true},{"image":{"id":286,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/286/thumb_096be863-a8f6-4b8b-93ea-55c459dd5050.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/286/medium_096be863-a8f6-4b8b-93ea-55c459dd5050.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/286/096be863-a8f6-4b8b-93ea-55c459dd5050.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/286/tower_096be863-a8f6-4b8b-93ea-55c459dd5050.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/286/landscape_096be863-a8f6-4b8b-93ea-55c459dd5050.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/286/square_096be863-a8f6-4b8b-93ea-55c459dd5050.jpg","description":"","depth":1,"collapsed":true},"depth":1,"collapsed":true}],"depth":1,"collapsed":true},{"id":135,"priority_index":5,"radius":20,"name":"City Art Gallery Of Ljubljana","description":"<p><b>History of the City Art Gallery of Ljubljana</b></p><p>The building at Mestni trg 5 was built in the early 16th century by Count Lanthieri. After having been a home for his family for 200 years, the house was acquired by the well-off trading family Zeschko in the 19th century. The great art lover Josipina Zeschko lived here, known as the “Glass Princess” due to her father’s trade in glass, who was later married to the manufacturer and big landowner Fidelis Terpinc, the owner of Fužine Castle. In 1866, the house was bought by the trader Hamann. It remained in use as a commercial building – until more recently there was a fur shop – up until 1963, when it was turned into an art gallery by way of a decree adopted by the Ljubljana Centre municipal people's committee. The building’s renovation according to plans designed by the architect Boris Kobe was managed by the Institute for the Regulation of Old Ljubljana.</p><p>After the Jakopič Pavilion started to be demolished in December 1961, the Pavilion’s directorate was left without business premises and an exhibition space. In November 1962, the Jakopič Pavilion was renamed the City Art Gallery whereby the expert public’s concerns as to the Jakopič Pavilion’s legal succession and the related construction of a new pavilion were allayed.</p><p>The new exhibition rooms at Mestni trg 5 were formally inaugurated as the exhibition premises of the City Art Gallery in October 1963. Apart from modernised exhibition halls (renovated in 1990 and 1991) and the renovated attic, the Gallery also acquired a café on the ground floor and in 2009 a reading room, where its visitors and art lovers are provided with a wide range of daily newspapers, catalogues as well as modern art magazines from Slovenian and foreign publishers.</p><p>After 50 years of engaging in exhibition activities and hosting numerous projects, the Gallery only started to form its own collection in the 1990s. In 1996, upon the acquisition of new premises at Mestni trg 4, the first exhibition of the permanent collection of the City Art Gallery of Ljubljana was staged. The collection which in 2009 became an integral part of the MGML collection comprises 190 works on paper by 70 Slovenian and six foreign artists. Since 1995, i.e. the year of commencing the collection activity, works by all prominent exponents of Slovenian art of the 20th century have been acquired, evidencing progress in the artists’ creative directions. As the collection policy provided for the acquisition of works by artists belonging to diverse periods and artistic styles, the collection’s span is therefore extensive – ranging from traditional, realistic depictions of the material world to fantastic and abstract representations. Owing to its heterogeneity in terms of ideas and the variety of technical approaches, the collection provides excellent opportunities for study.\r\nIn 2002, one section of the exhibition activity was moved to new premises, i.e. the Permanent Collection Gallery at Cankarjevo nabrežje 11/I. It was here that presentations of artists of different artistic styles mainly creating on paper were being held until December 2010.</p><p>The Bežigrad Gallery – one of Ljubljana’s smaller art galleries – has been active within the framework of the City Art Gallery since 1996. In addition, the Bežigrad Gallery II was opened in 2002. In 2009, at the initiative of the Municipality of Ljubljana, the City Art Gallery of Ljubljana including the Bežigrad Gallery was merged with the City Museum of Ljubljana to form an institution now called the Museum and Galleries of Ljubljana. In 2010, new premises in the Tobačna 001 Cultural Centre were acquired. In March 2011, a new exhibiting programme was launched in the 001 Gallery.</p><p><b>Exhibitions of the City Art Gallery of Ljubljana</b></p><p>During the 50 years of uninterrupted operation, numerous exhibitions were put on, with the Gallery’s programme changing in accordance with cultural needs and the growing exhibition opportunities in Ljubljana. The emphasis has been on a well-balanced relationship between exhibitions dealing with domestic and international artistic production, and between group and solo exhibitions, with a special focus on retrospective and overview exhibitions of renowned artists and monographic exhibitions of younger artists.</p><p>When faced with concrete exhibition-related problems, the Gallery has always provided its expert potential and invited both local and foreign experts to participate in addressing certain issues pertaining to individual areas and art genres. Moreover, our guests’ position on art could then be affirmed by selected exhibitions.</p><p>By organising retrospective and overview exhibitions, the Gallery has put on display many works of art by many of the most renowned Slovenian artists from various generations whilst, by exhibiting the current art production, the Gallery has attempted to present a specific excerpt from individual artists’ oeuvres. Special attention has always been paid to presenting younger artists and, especially, new generations of artists. The Gallery has always aimed to identify the most outstanding art phenomena in Slovenia.</p><p>Since 2009, the Gallery's exhibition programme has included the organisation of two overview or retrospective exhibitions of Slovenian artists a year, group presentations of conteporary Slovenian and international artists who, by using different media, show their integration into current artistic and social contexts and society at large.

The architect Jože Plečnik moved to a single-storey house at 4 Karunova street in Ljubljana’s Trnovo district in 1921. In the 1923-25 period the house was expanded westward by a cylindrical annex. After having bought the neighbouring house in 1929, Plečnik arranged a winter garden to the south. It is here that the master lived his isolated and unconventional life in privacy until his old age.</p><p>After Plečnik's death in 1957, his nephew Karel Matkovič moved to the house and started to sort out the master's extensive legacy consisting mainly of designs and correspondence. Thanks to Matkovič, Plečnik’s valuable legacy remained in the house almost intact. When Matkovič died in 1970, the heirs decided to sell the house including the legacy to the City of Ljubljana. Two years later, the Architecture Museum of Ljubljana was set up in the building.</p><p>On 1 April 1972, the Architectural Museum of Ljubljana based at Plečnik house opened its doors to the public. It remained there until 1992 when the majority of its departments moved to renovated premises at Fužine Castle which were allocated with the Museum’s basic tasks.</p><p>Plečnik house was arranged and opened to the public in 1974 when, due to the sensitivity of the paper materials, the collection of Plečnik's sketches and designs was moved from the museal section of the house to temporary storerooms at 4 Karunova street where the materials could be examined, arranged and studied.</p><p>The house contains rooms displaying the artist's valuable original furniture and personal objects, a collection of clay, plaster and wooden models of various projects, Plečnik's personal library and his drawing utensils. Today, visitors can see the entrance hall, the corridor, the kitchen, the bedroom with the bathroom, the small reception room, the spiral staircase, the master's studio on the upper floor and the winter garden. Due to the exceptional circumstances and intimacy of the site, the house can only be visited as part of guided tours. These are adapted to various age groups which must not contain more than seven people.</p><p>In 2001, a reception area for visitors was arranged on the ground floor of the house at 6 Karunova street, with the collection storage facilities being situated on the first floor. The collection comprises the architect’s extremely valuable original drawings and designs arranged by theme and project and in chronological order. An extensive share of the materials is accounted for by various projects for Ljubljana which nevertheless often remained on paper. Especially important are Plečnik’s early drawings from the Viennese and Prague periods, as well as designs for many Slovenian towns – regulations, renovations and proposals for monuments. Plečnik’s correspondence is similarly extensive as the architect occasionally corresponded with as many as 400 contemporaries, including some of the most renowned:\r\nOtto Wagner, Tomaš G. Masaryk, Ivan Hribar and many more. Also of great value is the collection of photographs containing Plečnik’s rare portraits and documentary photos of various projects during construction and upon completion. The storerooms also contain thesis projects of Plečnik’s students which were moved by the artist himself to his studio during World War Two. Special mention must be made of the diploma papers of the first two graduates from the Department of Architecture within the Technical Faculty in Ljubljana from 1924:\r\nDušan Grabrijan and France Tomažič, who were followed by Vinko Glanz, Edvard Ravnikar, Edvard Mihevc and others. The collection also comprises various wooden, plaster and clay models and an archive of “Ognjišče akademikov arhitektov” (the Academy of Architecture Collection).</p><p>Since mid-2010, Plečnik house has been managed by the Museum and Galleries of Ljubljana. Plans for the future include implementation of a conservation-restoration project aiming at preserving Plečnik's original arrangement. Apart from that, new museal contents will be added in that part of the house holding less significance in preservation terms.</p><p>The Plečnik collection department focuses on preserving the estate of the architect Jože Plečnik and on studying the time and circumstances in which the master lived and worked. An extensive collection of sketches and designs, models and photographs as well as the artist’s correspondence is kept, examined, processed and digitalised in order to facilitate better access to information and insight into individual topics for researchers and the interested public.</p><p>he curator is tasked with acquiring new materials to expand the collection, with informing the public about the life, work and significance of the great architect, as well as with participating in the presentation and promotion of Plečnik’s oeuvre both locally and abroad.</p>","url":"http://www.mgml.si/en/plecnik-house-503/","poi_type_id":1,"type_name":"Architecture","lon":"14.5023684","lat":"46.0424427","visit_duration":40,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/295/thumb_b9c08d72-c96c-44e9-b4eb-d5f741c078dd.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/295/medium_b9c08d72-c96c-44e9-b4eb-d5f741c078dd.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/295/b9c08d72-c96c-44e9-b4eb-d5f741c078dd.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/295/tower_b9c08d72-c96c-44e9-b4eb-d5f741c078dd.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/295/landscape_b9c08d72-c96c-44e9-b4eb-d5f741c078dd.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/295/square_b9c08d72-c96c-44e9-b4eb-d5f741c078dd.jpg","opening_hours":"N/A","tags":[{"tag_id":8,"name":"Jože

institutions. Its six departments collect, document, preserve, and investigate the mobile cultural heritage of Slovenia and present it to the public. Thanks to the exceptional educational level of its staff members, the museum also has the status of a research institution, and is involved in several scientific research projects focused on a more detailed study of the Slovenian cultural heritage. The quality of the museum activities in the central national museum depends on the staff and its consultants, with their excellent professional command of their fields and specific areas of specialization. Only through such an approach is it possible to present the cultural heritage of Slovenia to the public in a modern, attractive, and popular manner. The museum wishes to illuminate in detail through the presentation of material (in the form of scientific and popular publications and exhibitions) individual segments of the history of present-day Slovenia and make this available to the widest possible public. With the digitalization of material and the construction of an electronic database about the cultural heritage that its preserves, the National Museum of Slovenia has joined similar European institutions that are attempting to enable the broadest possible access to items of the cultural heritage through the use of modern information technology.</p>","url":"http://www.nms.si/","poi_type_id":2,"type_name":"Art & Museums","lon":"14.499309","lat":"46.052106","visit_duration":60,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/301/thumb_f8996bbf-9c47-4235-bef3-70be85c19d7e.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/301/medium_f8996bbf-9c47-4235-bef3-70be85c19d7e.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/301/f8996bbf-9c47-4235-bef3-70be85c19d7e.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/301/tower_f8996bbf-9c47-4235-bef3-70be85c19d7e.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/301/landscape_f8996bbf-9c47-4235-bef3-70be85c19d7e.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/301/square_f8996bbf-9c47-4235-bef3-70be85c19d7e.jpg","opening_hours":"N/A","details":{"wikipedia":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Museum_of_Slovenia","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/search/869199696425515/local_search?surface=tyah","twitter":"https://twitter.com/NarodniMuzejSLO","youtube":"","instagram":"","pinterest":"","depth":1,"collapsed":true},"address":{"address1":"Prešernova 20","city":"Ljubljana","post_code":"1000","country":"Slovenia","depth":1,"collapsed":true},"contact":{"name":"","email":"info@nms.si","telephone":"+386 1 24 14 400","fax":"+386 1 24 14 422","mobile":"","depth":1,"collapsed":true},"gallery":[{"image":{"id":301,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/301/thumb_f8996bbf-9c47-4235-bef3-70be85c19d7e.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/301/medium_f8996bbf-9c47-4235-bef3-70be85c19d7e.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/301/f8996bbf-9c47-4235-bef3-70be85c19d7e.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/301/tower_f8996bbf-9c47-4235-bef3-70be85c19d7e.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/301/landscape_f8996bbf-9c47-4235-bef3-70be85c19d7e.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/301/square_f8996bbf-9c47-4235-bef3-70be85c19d7e.jpg","description":"","depth":1,"collapsed":true},"depth":1,"collapsed":true},{"image":{"id":302,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/302/thumb_23186677-e06d-48d8-a955-781cda610aec.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/302/medium_23186677-e06d-48d8-a955-781cda610aec.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/302/23186677-e06d-48d8-a955-781cda610aec.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/302/tower_23186677-e06d-48d8-a955-781cda610aec.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/302/landscape_23186677-e06d-48d8-a955-781cda610aec.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/302/square_23186677-e06d-48d8-a955-781cda610aec.jpg","description":"","depth":1,"collapsed":true},"depth":1,"collapsed":true},{"image":{"id":303,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/303/thumb_124cc564-035d-4b4f-aa3e-949bd685a1b0.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/303/medium_124cc564-035d-4b4f-aa3e-949bd685a1b0.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/303/124cc564-035d-4b4f-aa3e-949bd685a1b0.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/303/tower_124cc564-035d-4b4f-aa3e-949bd685a1b0.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/303/landscape_124cc564-035d-4b4f-aa3e-949bd685a1b0.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/303/square_124cc564-035d-4b4f-aa3e-949bd685a1b0.jpg","description":"","depth":1,"collapsed":true},"depth":1,"collapsed":true},{"image":{"id":304,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/304/thumb_e967d714-d580-450c-9846-a90680485f00.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/304/medium_e967d714-d580-450c-9846-a90680485f00.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/304/e967d714-d580-450c-9846-a90680485f00.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/304/tower_e967d714-d580-450c-9846-a90680485f00.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/304/landscape_e967d714-d580-450c-9846-a90680485f00.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/304/square_e967d714-d580-450c-9846-a90680485f00.jpg","description":"","depth":1,"collapsed":true},"depth":1,"collapsed":true}],"depth":1,"collapsed":true},{"id":140,"priority_index":4,"radius":20,"name":"National Gallery Of Slovenia","description":"<p>The National Gallery Society was founded in 1918, although the endeavors to establish a home of Slovenian art (an \"acropolis\" as it was named on the founding) had already been initiated towards the end of the 19th century. The Initiative to establish a national gallery was undertaken by the aristocratic polymath and correspondent Peter Radics and the mayor of Ljubljana, Dr Ivan Hribar, followed by the Christian Art Society which, in 1907, compiled a collection of older Slovenian art. In short, throughout the decades there had been kept alive the irrepressible desire of the Slovenians to have their own arts institution − a desire that was ultimately fulfilled in 1925, with the acquisition of the Narodni dom (National Hall). Likewise important was the regular annual acquisition of works of art: with the legacy from the Strahl will of 1929, it may be said that the National Gallery acquired a considerable fund of works by domestic and European painters, which in 1930 was first exhibited to the public. In 1927 the commissioned casts from the Louvre were brought from Paris to Ljubljana and magnificently installed in the \"Slovenian Louvre\". The fund from the donation by Dr Fran Windischer − who was at the same time a patron, then from 1929 also President of the National Gallery Society − was a contribution of exceptional value to the art collection; the Windischer Fund − the first legacy in the history of the institution − is still today the foundation of the gallery's collection.</p><p>Thus from the first dreams of the initiators, and with the high cultural awareness of all Slovenians, the National Gallery developed into one of the most eminent cultural and artistic institutions. Already on 22 June 1933, the Gallery had arranged the ceremonial opening of the expanded permanent collection of Slovenian art. From all parts of the homeland and from abroad there arrived congratulatory telegrams and greetings-cards to mark the great event. The Gallery had achieved professional success and was beginning to enjoy a great reputation among the Slovene public.</p><p>Likewise, at this time, we must not overlook the exceptional selfless dedication of the first directors of the National Gallery of Slovenia. The first to take up the post of Director of the Gallery was Ivan Zorman; until 1950 he successfully led and carried out all the renovation works in the Narodni dom Palace, while at the same time shaping and expanding the permanent collection, always with the aid of the art-history experts, who gave their devoted support to the Gallery (particularly Dr Izidor Cankar, Dr France Mesesnel and Dr France Stele). The second director was Dr Karel Dobida, who headed the Gallery until September 1964. He promoted the systematic introduction of annual exhibitions, and by so doing filled in a gap in the art-history profession. The first monograph exhibitions, on Ivan Grohar and the brothers Šubic, were followed in 1951 by the great monograph exhibition Fortunat Bergant, in 1957 Kremser-Schmidt, in 1959 the exhibition Mediaeval Frescoes in Slovene Lands, in 1961 The Baroque in Slovene Lands, and in 1960 and 1964 the exhibitions of Foreign Old Masters. In 1956, Dr Emilijan Cevc issued the first publication in the collection Vodnik po umetnostnih zbirkah Narodne galerije (Umetnost srednjega veka na Slovenskem) (Guide to the art collections of the National Gallery (Medieval art in Slovenian land)), and in 1958 appeared the Vodnik po Narodni galeriji (Guide to the National Gallery) with a text by Dr Karl Dobida, presenting the history of the Gallery and a brief survey of the permanent collection.</p><p>On 1 July 1946, the National Gallery was taken under the charge of the People's Republic of Slovenia and became a state gallery with firmer economic and organizational foundations. Despite the pressure on space caused by the increasing number of exhibitions, and the ever greater overstocking of the depots, the Gallery tirelessly continued with its established programme.</p><p>When in 1951 the Moderna galerija (Museum of Modern Art) opened its permanent collection, supplemented by the fund from the National Gallery of Slovenia, both institutions were being directed by Dr Karl Dobida, and the exhibitions there were also being set up by curators from the Gallery.</p><p>Numerous further exhibitions were to follow up to the 50th anniversary of the National Gallery of Slovenia − at that time directed by Dr Anica Cevc − and each individually marked an important milestone on research into the Slovenian artistic past. The grand jubilee, in 1968, was celebrated by opening of the exhibition Umetnost XVII. stoletja na Slovenskem (Art of the XVII. Century in Slovenian Lands), which comprised painting, sculpture, illuminated manuscripts, tombstones, reliefs, graphics and artisanal art. One of the most important exhibitions in the art-history profession was Gotska plastika na Slovenskem (Gothic Sculpture in Slovenian lands), in 1973, under the direction of Dr Emilijan Cevc; the exhibition presented the artistic position of the Slovenian provinces in the Middle Ages.</p><p>Another special turning-point was the exhibition Kitajsko slikarstvo (Chinese Painting) in 1988, which was up till then the most visited exhibition at the National Gallery of Slovenia. The year 1988 was also the one in which the Gallery, by taking over the building of the Klub delegatov (Delegates Club), moved forward into the new period of architectural development. Preparations were begun for construction of the extension, and in 1991 the initial construction works for the new building by the architect Edvard Ravnikar were effectively begun. At the same time, in summer 1991, on account of the military aggression against Slovenia, all the staff of the National Gallery of Slovenia had to evacuate the works of art with the greatest urgency and transfer them to safe storage in the deepest basement spaces of the gallery.</p><p>When Dr Anica Cevc, the long-time Director, retired in autumn 1991, she was succeeded by Dr Andrej Smrekar.</p><p>The collection of “foreign” old masters again saw the light of day with the exhibitions Foreign Masters from 14th to 20th Century (1983), European Still Lifes from Slovenian Collections (1989) and European Painters from Slovenian Collections (1993). The world-renowned expert Frederico Zeri and Dr Ksenija Rozman authored the latter exhibition. It laid the foundations for the opening of the Permanent Collection of European Painters in the New Wing of the Gallery in 1997.</p><p>The Narodni dom Palace was declared a cultural monument in 1993. In 1995, the society called Friends of the National Gallery of Slovenia was founded, realising an idea that went back the very beginning of the National Gallery Society in 1918. Amongst the projects of all-Slovenian significance, one which stands out in particular, is the great exhibition Gotika v Sloveniji (Gothic Art in Slovenia), which the Gallery presented in 1995 in co-operation with the Faculty of Arts, University of Ljubljana. The exhibition comprised, on a theoretical basis, all genres of art and the entire Slovene ethnic territory, and involved numerous experts from Slovenia and abroad for the critical treatment of the material. The project at the same time opened the doors of the new gallery building, thus making its landmark in the history of the National Gallery of Slovenia. With its new spaces, the gallery enriched its physical possibilities for performing the basic tasks established as far back as in 1918, i.e.: to safeguard the heritage of the Slovenian people, and to transmit it to the public at the highest possible professional level. Diverse series of exhibitions is proof of ambitious and thoughtful programming. Among the large scale exhibitions we should mention the outstanding exhibition Zakladi slovenskih cerkva (Treasures of Slovenian Churches) (1999) and the monograph survey presentation Življenje in delo baročnega slikarja Valentina Metzingerja (The Life and Work of the Baroque Painter Valentin Metzinger), by the author and long-standing Director of Gallery, Dr Anica Cevc, who prepared the exhibition in the year 2000.</p><p>For the National Gallery of Slovenia, perhaps the most crucially important year was 2001, when construction works were completed on the new Entrance Hall, designed by Sadar Vuga Architects. This meant that the National Gallery had opened itself to new tasks and new forms of transmitting the cultural heritage in a world of changing relations between the viewing and the museum institutions, which − as for all national galleries worldwide − will be determined and shaped only by time.</p><p>Noteworthy was the exhibition of prints by Marjan Pogačnik, who donated his collection to the Gallery in 2002. That year, the Gallery programme was enriched by exhibitions dedicated to Biedermaier painter Jožef Tominc and to Baroque painting in Gorizia. The latter represented the first comprehensive art-history study of an entire crown land in Slovenia. Also based on field studies were the exhibitions on Zorzi Ventura Brajković (2003) and on Master HGG, Brajković’s contemporary from central Slovenia and Croatia (2004); 2005 saw the exhibition on Almanach, a younger and mysterious painter, who was presented within the context of his contemporaries. That same year the Gallery highlighted neoclassical painter Franc Kavčič/Caucig. His pictures for the Auersperg Palace in Vienna followed in two years and the themes of Antiquity in 2010. Exhibition of manuscripts from the Žiče Charterhouse in 2006 was unique for its rare and fragile artefacts. Portraits of Bishops of Ljubljana, resulting from a large-scale research project, followed in 2007.</p><p>The 2008 relocation of the Robba Fountain to the Gallery drew much attention. The long-planned undertaking was carried out during the tenure of Dr Barbara Jaki, the Director of the National Gallery of Slovenia since 2005. The occasion was marked by a symposium on the Robba Fountain and Robba’s oeuvre in 2010.</p><p>Slovenian Impressionists and Their Time 1890–1920 was a landmark exhibition and research project of the Gallery. Realized in 2008, the grand-scale exhibition saw a rapturous reception by the public. It initiated the exhibition of Slovenian Impressionists in the Parisian Petit Palais in 2013. In 2009, a travelling exhibition Works of Art from Prekmurje was mounted, one of rare regional overviews of art styles. The same year saw two exhibitions featuring works on paper, First Prints and Drawing in Slovenia I. The oeuvre of a sculptor Aljoz Gangl followed in 2010. New acquisitions of the National Gallery of Slovenia between 2001 and 2010 were presented in detail in 2012. In 2014 and 2015, paintings and sculpture of the Government Art Collection were showcased to the public. The Gallery took over the custody of the Collection from the Executive Council of the Socialist Republic of Slovenia in 1986.</p><p>Long past its due, the renovation of the Narodni dom Palace and the expansion of the Gallery started in 2012. The project was concluded with the inauguration of the new Permanent Collection of Art of Slovenia on 27 January 2016. At the grand opening, the bronze portrait of Dr Anica Cevc (1926–2011), a longtime Director of the Gallery, was unveiled. The sculpture is the work of Mirsad Begić.</p><p>The complex of the National Gallery of Slovenia is made of three integrated wings. It encompasses 12,670 m2, with exhibition spaces covering 3,955 m2.

A permanent exhibition of other key sciences needed for a railway to operate is located in the nearby ancillary building of the rotunda.\r\nIn the first room, one can experience the atmosphere in stationmaster’s office at a small railway station in the final years of the Austria-Hungary monarchy, equipped with everything needed for traffic management and ticket sales.</p><p>The second room contains nine types of railway tracks from various periods and railway administrations, reflecting various rulers on the Slovenian territory. Small railway vehicles with trolleys standing on them were once used by line supervisors and maintainers. Manual tools and aids bear witness to how difficult maintenance used to be. The development of the railway network in Slovenia is presented with seven maps from different periods, alongside which old railway boundary stones remind us of the past.</p><p>One museum room is devoted to basic devices for the transmission of messages, like telegraphs, telephones and teleprinters, as well as apparatuses of higher levels like short-wave and FM radio stations, devices for registration of telephone conversations, station public address systems, as well as system of railway clocks.</p><p>A special space is set aside for railway uniforms, the \"garment of honour\", as designed over time. Here, certain work equipment of railway workers is also gathered, including the especially charming manual railway lanterns.</p><p>In the area of signalling and safety devices, the museum contains a representative collection of electromechanical and electrodynamic block devices and other devices – both dating back to the oldest and more recent history.

Gallery","description":"<p>The 2007 renovation of the premises of the former Križanke Cultural and Information Centre gave rise to the Vžigalica Gallery.\r\nThe space has not only undergone a transformation in terms of physical renovation, image and name, but mainly as regards its programme and organisation. The Vžigalica Gallery has risen to prominence as a venue for varied projects pertaining to contemporary visual, audio-visual, performance and other art practices. So far, the co-operation with non-governmental and other organisations active in the field of culture has yielded results and offered new perspectives on both sides, which is why this co-operation is continuing.</p><p>During the time of its existence, the Vžigalica Gallery has hosted diverse exhibitions which were either part of larger projects and festivals or independent presentations of major names of world art and young artists, even artists in residence. Apart from that, the Gallery has also been engaged in both domestic and international projects whose production was specially adjusted to the venue.</p><p>The Vžigalica Gallery retains its basic concept of a smaller yet extremely flexible art gallery in the very centre of Ljubljana. Its task will remain to encourage various reactions of both culture and art to the idea of urban culture and, at the same time, to contribute to defining this phenomenon.</p><p>By making public invitations for projects we aim to encourage the non-governmental sector, artists and other organisations to respond to the phenomena occurring in the urban cultural space in which we live, and to place them in a wider context of contemporary culture and art. The broader context means both an expanded view in the geographical sense, i.e. familiarity with the macrocosmos of international production and the culture of contemporary society at large; as well as the broad-mindedness of the artist’s or curator’s attitude to a certain visual work of art, installation, audio-visual object or performance practice. Our intention is to continue to study the concept of urbanity, i.e. to identify the artistic attributes of the town, the challenges posed by urban culture, and to find out how to address them when a broad range of starting points is taken into account: artistic, educational, scientific, creative, visual, aural, virtual, historical, social and many more.</p><p>The Gallery’s objective is to act as a laboratory for new ideas, creative formulas and different attitudes which invariably arise from high-quality contemporary artistic production.</p><p>The projects presented are compiled bearing in mind the fact that the Vžigalica Gallery is the most flexible part of Ljubljana’s central museal and gallery institution whose fundamental values as regards presentations of both the heritage and contemporary art practices reflect accessibility, quality production, instructiveness, professional competence, creativity and co-operation.</p>","url":"http://www.mgml.si/en/vzigalica-gallery/","poi_type_id":2,"type_name":"Art &

Vintgar Gorge","description":"<p><b>Discovery of the gorge</b></p><p>This ravine in the immediate vicinity of Gorje, approximately 4 km north-west of Bled, was discovered by Jakob Žumer, the Major of Gorje, and the cartographer and photographer Benedikt Lergetporer in 1891. The natural form of the gorge was impassable, but was soon arranged and opened for public due to the tourist development of Bled which took place already in those days. Due to its natural beauty, Vintgar was classified among the more important tourist sights in Slovenia and the number of visitors increases every year.</p><p><b>Description</b></p><p>The 1.6 km long Vintgar gorge carves its way through the vertical rocks of the Hom and Bort hills and is graced by the Radovna with its waterfalls, pools and rapids. The educational trail leads you over wooden bridges and Žumr’s galleries, and ends with a bridge overlooking the mighty 13 m high Šum waterfall.</p><p>The Vintgar gorge also includes two man-made sights. The single-arch stone bridge of the Bohinj railway, constructed in 1906, which crosses the gorge 33.5 m above the trail, and the dam from which the water is routed to the small Vintgar hydroelectric power plant under the Šum waterfall.</p><p><b>The origin of the name</b></p><p>To one interpretation, the name Vintgar originates from German Weingarten (the vineyards in the nearby Podhom), whilst the other interpretation says that the gorge section reminds on the wine glass. Following the example of Bled's Vintgar such names were also given to other similar gorges in Slovenia (Iški vintgar, Ribnica vintgar above Srednja vas in Bohinj, Bistrica vintgar).</p><p><b>Vegetation</b></p><p>Due to the particular climate and micro relief conditions the Vintgar gorge represents a home for numerous plant species, which differ from the vegetation characteristic for the surrounding area. The amateur botanist and priest Janez Šafer was the first to pay attention to these plant species.

Castle terraces offer spectacular views of the lake and the island, down the Dežela area with Lesce and Radovljica and over to the mountain ranges of the Karavanke and the Julian Alps.</p><p>It has been over a thousand years since on 10 April 1004 the German king Henry II conferred the estate of Bled located in the province called in Carniola on Bishop Albuin of Brixen and his church. In 1011 Henry II awarded Albuin's successor, Adalberon, the castle on the cliff (castellum Veldes) in a charter in which the castle was first explicitly mentioned. The Bled Castle was the administrative seat of the Brixen estate in the Gorenjsko region. Medieval documents refer to Bled with its German name Veldes. In terms of written documents, Bled Castle is the oldest castle in Slovenia. Castle buildings are arranged around the lower and upper courtyards.</p><p>The fame of Bled and its beauties was spread around the world by world travellers, including Janez Vajkard Valvasor and his Glory of the Duchy of Carniola of 1689.</p><p>Owing to its strategic geographic location, Bled has always been an important venue of high–level political and other official meetings. Its castle has been visited by a number of high-ranking statesmen who enjoyed the breathtakingly beautiful views of the surrounding nature.</p>\r\n","url":"http://www.blejski-grad.si/en/about-bled-castle","poi_type_id":1,"type_name":"Architecture","lon":"14.10099224","lat":"46.37037685","visit_duration":120,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/224/thumb_80bf976b-1c15-4943-9587-55bff27dd2ce.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/224/medium_80bf976b-1c15-4943-9587-55bff27dd2ce.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/224/80bf976b-1c15-4943-9587-55bff27dd2ce.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/224/tower_80bf976b-1c15-4943-9587-55bff27dd2ce.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/224/landscape_80bf976b-1c15-4943-9587-55bff27dd2ce.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/224/square_80bf976b-1c15-4943-9587-55bff27dd2ce.jpg","opening_hours":"N/A","tags":[{"tag_id":12,"name":"Castle","category_id":1,"depth":2,"collapsed":true}],"details":{"wikipedia":"","facebook":"","twitter":"","youtube":"","instagram":"","pinterest":"","depth":2,"collapsed":true},"address":{"address1":"Grajska cesta","city":"Bled","post_code":"4260","country":"Slovenia","depth":2,"collapsed":true},"contact":{"name":"","email":"blejski.grad@zkbled.si","telephone":"+386 (0)4 572 97 82","fax":"","mobile":"","depth":2,"collapsed":true},"gallery":[{"image":{"id":224,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/224/thumb_80bf976b-1c15-4943-9587-55bff27dd2ce.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/224/medium_80bf976b-1c15-4943-9587-55bff27dd2ce.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/224/80bf976b-1c15-4943-9587-55bff27dd2ce.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/224/tower_80bf976b-1c15-4943-9587-55bff27dd2ce.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/224/landscape_80bf976b-1c15-4943-9587-55bff27dd2ce.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/224/square_80bf976b-1c15-4943-9587-55bff27dd2ce.jpg","description":"","depth":2,"collapsed":true},"depth":2,"collapsed":true},{"image":{"id":225,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/225/thumb_83f69793-35ae-4a4e-a2dc-fd208b7b20e0.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/225/medium_83f69793-35ae-4a4e-a2dc-fd208b7b20e0.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/225/83f69793-35ae-4a4e-a2dc-fd208b7b20e0.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/225/tower_83f69793-35ae-4a4e-a2dc-fd208b7b20e0.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/225/landscape_83f69793-35ae-4a4e-a2dc-fd208b7b20e0.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/225/square_83f69793-35ae-4a4e-a2dc-fd208b7b20e0.jpg","description":"","depth":2,"collapsed":true},"depth":2,"collapsed":true},{"image":{"id":226,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/226/thumb_a3829642-d220-4e81-b2a8-38bde897f792.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/226/medium_a3829642-d220-4e81-b2a8-38bde897f792.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/226/a3829642-d220-4e81-b2a8-38bde897f792.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/226/tower_a3829642-d220-4e81-b2a8-38bde897f792.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/226/landscape_a3829642-d220-4e81-b2a8-38bde897f792.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/226/square_a3829642-d220-4e81-b2a8-38bde897f792.jpg","description":"","depth":2,"collapsed":true},"depth":2,"collapsed":true}],"depth":2,"collapsed":true}],"depth":2,"collapsed":true},{"id":7,"name":"Bohinj","headline":"","longitude":13.9427,"latitude":46.3006,"priority_index":2,"image_thumb":"/images/navigation_type/image/7/thumb_31a71c88-2723-4e6e-a17c-2f7102f1afe7.jpg","image_thumb_small":"/images/navigation_type/image/7/thumb_small_31a71c88-2723-4e6e-a17c-2f7102f1afe7.jpg","image_medium":"/images/navigation_type/image/7/medium_31a71c88-2723-4e6e-a17c-2f7102f1afe7.jpg","image":"/images/navigation_type/image/7/31a71c88-2723-4e6e-a17c-2f7102f1afe7.jpg","pois":[null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,{"id":105,"priority_index":6,"radius":50,"name":"Savica Waterfall","description":"<p>Bohinj Lake has numerous inflows, the most important one is the Savica.

The park was named after Triglav, the highest mountain in the heart of the park, which is also the highest summit in Slovenia (2864 m). The origin of the name Triglav is rather uncertain. Triglav (»three-headed«) owes its name to its characteristic shape as seen from the south-east side or to the highest Slavic deity who was supposed to have its throne on the top of the mountain. The mountain is a true national symbol and is featured on the national coat of arms and the flag.</p><p>The Triglav National Park extends along the Italian border and close to the Austrian border in the north-west of Slovenia, that is, in the south-eastern section of the Alps. Its territory is nearly identical with that occupied by the Eastern Julian Alps. The park covers 880 square kilometres, or 3% of the territory of Slovenia. The Triglav National Park is among the earliest European parks; the first protection dates back to 1924 when the Alpine Conservation Park was founded. The principal task of the Triglav National Park Public Institution is the protection of the park, but it also carries out specialist and research

Partisan Hospital","description":"<p>The Franja Partisan hospital is one of the few preserved partisan hospitals. It represents a symbol of Slovene partisan health care and bears witness to incredible humanity and self-sacrifice of the health care and other personnel taking care of the wounded. The complex of the Franja Partisan Hospital is comprised of 14 wooden barracks and several auxiliary facilities. They were gradually built in the narrow, difficult to access Pasica gorge in Dolenji Novaki near Cerkno. The construction lasted from December 1943 to May 1945. The hospital was named after a partisan doctor, Dr. Franja Bojc Bidovec, who shortly after the hospital was established, took on the function of its administrator.<p/><p>The Franja Partisan Hospital was among the best equipped secret patizan hospitals with an operating room, X-ray, disability ward and even electricity plant.<p/><p>It could admit up to 100 wounded and provided treatment for a total of 578 persons, especially seriously wounded. The hospital also included several dislocated wards for lightly wounded. All wards provided treatment to about 900 wounded of various nationalities.<p/><p>The Franja Partisan Hospital is a cultural monument of national importance, is entered in UNESCO's Tentative List of World Heritage, and bears the European Heritage Label. After the disastrous flood that occurred in September 2007, the monument has been reconstructed almost in its entirety, and is reopened for visitors from May 2010. Despite the loss of authentic tangible heritage, it has remained a symbol of international alliance and resistance, and above all a precious reminder of humanity, nobleness, and comradeship.<p/>","url":"http://www.turizem-cerkno.si/en/sights/partizanska-bolnica-franja.html","poi_type_id":2,"type_name":"Art & Museums","lon":"14.02826628","lat":"46.15390248","visit_duration":120,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/119/thumb_7ce363a0-674a-4ce1-9628-480fcc525e50.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/119/medium_7ce363a0-674a-4ce1-9628-480fcc525e50.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/119/7ce363a0-674a-4ce1-9628-480fcc525e50.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/119/tower_7ce363a0-674a-4ce1-9628-480fcc525e50.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/119/landscape_7ce363a0-674a-4ce1-9628-480fcc525e50.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/119/square_7ce363a0-674a-4ce1-9628-480fcc525e50.jpg","opening_hours":"N/A","details":{"wikipedia":"https://sl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenska_vojna_partizanska_bolnica_Franja","facebook":"","twitter":"","youtube":"","instagram":"","pinterest":"","depth":2,"collapsed":true},"address":{"address1":"Dolenji Novaki pri Cerknem","city":"Cerkno","post_code":"5282","country":"Slovenia","depth":2,"collapsed":true},"contact":{"name":"","email":"Info@Turizem-Cerkno.Si","telephone":"+386 (0)5 373 46 45","fax":"","mobile":"+386 (0)51 378 415","depth":2,"collapsed":true},"gallery":[{"image":{"id":119,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/119/thumb_7ce363a0-674a-4ce1-9628-480fcc525e50.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/119/medium_7ce363a0-674a-4ce1-9628-480fcc525e50.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/119/7ce363a0-674a-4ce1-9628-480fcc525e50.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/119/tower_7ce363a0-674a-4ce1-9628-480fcc525e50.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/119/landscape_7ce363a0-674a-4ce1-9628-480fcc525e50.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/119/square_7ce363a0-674a-4ce1-9628-480fcc525e50.jpg","description":"Franja Partisan Hospital","depth":2,"collapsed":true},"depth":2,"collapsed":true},{"image":{"id":120,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/120/thumb_3fdf0ff3-7afe-463a-8e6e-daaa2cd2360f.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/120/medium_3fdf0ff3-7afe-463a-8e6e-daaa2cd2360f.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/120/3fdf0ff3-7afe-463a-8e6e-daaa2cd2360f.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/120/tower_3fdf0ff3-7afe-463a-8e6e-daaa2cd2360f.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/120/landscape_3fdf0ff3-7afe-463a-8e6e-daaa2cd2360f.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/120/square_3fdf0ff3-7afe-463a-8e6e-daaa2cd2360f.jpg","description":"Gorge Pasice","depth":2,"collapsed":true},"depth":2,"collapsed":true},{"image":{"id":121,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/121/thumb_87f2004c-a7ca-4bea-85cc-72b17be461fd.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/121/medium_87f2004c-a7ca-4bea-85cc-72b17be461fd.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/121/87f2004c-a7ca-4bea-85cc-72b17be461fd.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/121/tower_87f2004c-a7ca-4bea-85cc-72b17be461fd.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/121/landscape_87f2004c-a7ca-4bea-85cc-72b17be461fd.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/121/square_87f2004c-a7ca-4bea-85cc-72b17be461fd.jpg","description":"","depth":2,"collapsed":true},"depth":2,"collapsed":true},{"image":{"id":122,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/122/thumb_b0aa65ff-84c8-427f-ab9e-fb33937bea1d.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/122/medium_b0aa65ff-84c8-427f-ab9e-fb33937bea1d.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/122/b0aa65ff-84c8-427f-ab9e-fb33937bea1d.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/122/tower_b0aa65ff-84c8-427f-ab9e-fb33937bea1d.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/122/landscape_b0aa65ff-84c8-427f-ab9e-fb33937bea1d.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/122/square_b0aa65ff-84c8-427f-ab9e-fb33937bea1d.jpg","description":"","depth":2,"collapsed":true},"depth":2,"collapsed":true},{"image":{"id":123,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/123/thumb_7199bfec-6118-4963-8d89-af14180d83cf.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/123/medium_7199bfec-6118-4963-8d89-af14180d83cf.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/123/7199bfec-6118-4963-8d89-af14180d83cf.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/123/tower_7199bfec-6118-4963-8d89-af14180d83cf.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/123/landscape_7199bfec-6118-4963-8d89-af14180d83cf.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/123/square_7199bfec-6118-4963-8d89-af14180d83cf.jpg","description":"","depth":2,"collapsed":true},"depth":2,"collapsed":true}],"depth":2,"collapsed":true},null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,{"id":109,"priority_index":3,"radius":20,"name":"Forest Selfness","description":"<p>Forest selfness is a copyrighted work, which was developed in the Local tourist organisation Laufar Cerkno.

In order to make it easy for bees to find their hives, the endings were all stained and painted. Handmade artistic beehive endings are a big part of Slovenian cultural heritage.</p><p>In the private beekeeping farm museum you will be kindly escorted through the history of beekeeping. Many items that were previously used by beekeepers for the production of honey can be seen. Exhibited objects such as pottery utensils and shoe accessories show traditions from past lives.</p><p>The musem shop is neatly arranged, and different types of local honey, propolis, pollen, honey brandy and other products made from beeswax can be bought.</p><p>Beekeeper Franci Strupi has been beekeeping since 1982. Today he works with 70 or 80 bee families in three beehouses.</p>","url":"http://www.tourism-cerklje.si/en/What-to-do/Museeums/Beekeeping-farm-museum","poi_type_id":2,"type_name":"Art & Museums","lon":"14.48816468","lat":"46.2317535","visit_duration":60,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/169/thumb_39536a13-39e8-42e6-b087-aac8fffcab1e.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/169/medium_39536a13-39e8-42e6-b087-aac8fffcab1e.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/169/39536a13-39e8-42e6-b087-aac8fffcab1e.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/169/tower_39536a13-39e8-42e6-b087-aac8fffcab1e.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/169/landscape_39536a13-39e8-42e6-b087-aac8fffcab1e.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/169/square_39536a13-39e8-42e6-b087-aac8fffcab1e.jpg","opening_hours":"N/A","details":{"wikipedia":"","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Cebelarski-Muzej-Strupi/431300880278968","twitter":"","youtube":"","instagram":"","pinterest":"","depth":2,"collapsed":true},"address":{"address1":"Sp.

Krvavec is also the most easily accessible ski slope of the Slovenian Alps and the nearest to Ljubljana, with frequent flight connections to Paris and London. In the winter it attracts skiers, and in the summer it offers many opportunities for hiking or cycling tours. Skiers and travelers are attracted by the untouched nature of Krvavec with its beautiful outlooks onto neighbouring ridges, and its fantastic genuine local food.</p><p>Most Slovenians believe that Krvavec only provides good skiing and winter adventures, however there is much more to it than that. Its warm hiking face can be seen throughout the spring, summer and autumn months.</p><p>Krvavec is the nearest ski resort to Ljubljana (25km away) and Kranj (17km away), and also a pleasant mountain trekking point. Krvavec is the top mountain of the Kališko ridge, which is linked to the main axis of the Kamnik Alps.</p><p>What was formerly a glacier has shaped around the slope of Krvavec, so over time the sparse trees and dwarf pine have been cut and Alpine meadows have been created around the mountain peak. The peaks main identification point is the RTV Slovenia iron concrete transmission tower, which in the eighties replaced the metal tower, which had been built into the hillside in 1955.</p><p>The cable car and cable airway Gospinc operates throughout summer, which takes you to the home of Krvavec. Alpine meadows and ridges around Krvavec are very comfortable for walking and are extremely scenic locations in the Ljubljana basin. After embracing the nature, views, hiking and adrenaline pumping excitement of Krvavec, you can settle down for a true gourmet experience, and enjoy many domestic culinary specialities such as; buckwheat, sour milk, sausages, blood sausage with sauerkraut, dry and semi-dry sausages, roast beef, mush, maselnek, homemade bread and delicious stews.</p><p>Tours from the mountain lodge at Gopsinec, which is close to the upper cable car station:</p><p>• Veliki Zvon – 1971 m and one hours walk</p><p>• The top of Koren – 1999 m and a good two hours walk</p><p>• Kalški greben – 2224 m and a three and a half hours walk</p><p>• Over the Kalški greben or Dolge njive to Cojzov's hut on the Kokriška sedlo (saddle) (1973 m) – between five and six hours walk</p><p>The beautiful nature, unique views, medicinal herbs and tours are among many reasons to visit Krvavec in the summer. Since Krvavec is a higher level above the sea, its pastures were transformed into ski slopes. The renewed cable car (with panoramic cars for 6 people) carries up to 2000 people every hour to the central mountain ski resort at the passage of the Kamnik Alps. There are approximately 106 hectares of ski area available to visitors between the upper cable car station at Gospinec (1450m) and the highest point of the ski slopes at Zvoh (1971 m). In the lower part of Krvavec on the Kriška planina, there is also a 5 km long track specially set aside for walking and cross country skiing.</p><p>Because of its beauty and purity, Krvavec is perfect for summer hiking and winter skiing, with a complex of slopers at an altitude of between 1450m and 1971m. This means over 30km of ordered ski tracks.</p>","url":"http://www.tourism-cerklje.si/en/What-to-do/Krvavec","poi_type_id":12,"type_name":"Nature","lon":"14.49598622","lat":"46.28497308","visit_duration":300,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/180/thumb_fac5e6ff-e640-428a-8be3-8e952dd514e0.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/180/medium_fac5e6ff-e640-428a-8be3-8e952dd514e0.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/180/fac5e6ff-e640-428a-8be3-8e952dd514e0.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/180/tower_fac5e6ff-e640-428a-8be3-8e952dd514e0.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/180/landscape_fac5e6ff-e640-428a-8be3-8e952dd514e0.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/180/square_fac5e6ff-e640-428a-8be3-8e952dd514e0.jpg","opening_hours":"N/A","details":{"wikipedia":"","facebook":"","twitter":"","youtube":"","instagram":"","pinterest":"","depth":2,"collapsed":true},"address":{"address1":"Krvavec","city":"Cerklje

guides over almost two hundred years. At the same time it is the largest Classical Karst cave and the most visited cave in Europe. Already in 1872, railway tracks were installed in the cave, and in 1884, electricity was also installed. Today, visitors can satisfy their curiosity by learning about the origin of the caves, by examining the passages and chambers, and especially by observing the rising stalagmites or hanging stalactites, the joining columns, the creasing curtains, and the strings of endless fantastic shapes. The cave is easily accessible and has no steps or steep inclines; part of the cave is viewed from the train, and the rest can be observed on foot. The Postojna Cave is also considered the birthplace of speleobiology. The Postojna-Planina cave system is the home of as many as 85 completely adapted animal species, making it the world’s largest cave ecosystem, and the crown jewel of biological diversity. The most famous inhabitant is of course the olm, or the human fish (Proteus anguinus).</p>","url":"http://www.postojnska-jama.eu/en/home/","poi_type_id":12,"type_name":"Nature","lon":"14.20363953","lat":"45.78260137","visit_duration":120,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/161/thumb_64ef0b3f-605a-4b00-b61a-70924277b305.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/161/medium_64ef0b3f-605a-4b00-b61a-70924277b305.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/161/64ef0b3f-605a-4b00-b61a-70924277b305.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/161/tower_64ef0b3f-605a-4b00-b61a-70924277b305.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/161/landscape_64ef0b3f-605a-4b00-b61a-70924277b305.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/161/square_64ef0b3f-605a-4b00-b61a-70924277b305.jpg","opening_hours":"N/A","tags":[{"tag_id":28,"name":"Cave","category_id":12,"depth":2,"collapsed":true}],"details":{"wikipedia":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postojna_Cave","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/PostojnaCave/","twitter":"","youtube":"","instagram":"","pinterest":"","depth":2,"collapsed":true},"address":{"address1":"Jamska cesta 30","city":"Postojna","post_code":"6230","country":"Slovenia","depth":2,"collapsed":true},"contact":{"name":"","email":"info@postojnska-jama.eu","telephone":"+386 5 700 01 00","fax":"+386 5 700 01 30","mobile":"","depth":2,"collapsed":true},"gallery":[{"image":{"id":161,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/161/thumb_64ef0b3f-605a-4b00-b61a-70924277b305.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/161/medium_64ef0b3f-605a-4b00-b61a-70924277b305.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/161/64ef0b3f-605a-4b00-b61a-70924277b305.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/161/tower_64ef0b3f-605a-4b00-b61a-70924277b305.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/161/landscape_64ef0b3f-605a-4b00-b61a-70924277b305.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/161/square_64ef0b3f-605a-4b00-b61a-70924277b305.jpg","description":"","depth":2,"collapsed":true},"depth":2,"collapsed":true},{"image":{"id":162,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/162/thumb_e1712cb8-7999-4ef0-adaa-d24b6af9b4c8.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/162/medium_e1712cb8-7999-4ef0-adaa-d24b6af9b4c8.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/162/e1712cb8-7999-4ef0-adaa-d24b6af9b4c8.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/162/tower_e1712cb8-7999-4ef0-adaa-d24b6af9b4c8.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/162/landscape_e1712cb8-7999-4ef0-adaa-d24b6af9b4c8.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/162/square_e1712cb8-7999-4ef0-adaa-d24b6af9b4c8.jpg","description":"","depth":2,"collapsed":true},"depth":2,"collapsed":true},{"image":{"id":163,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/163/thumb_a7fb7d7e-41f0-456a-a27f-35fc02b1cdd0.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/163/medium_a7fb7d7e-41f0-456a-a27f-35fc02b1cdd0.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/163/a7fb7d7e-41f0-456a-a27f-35fc02b1cdd0.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/163/tower_a7fb7d7e-41f0-456a-a27f-35fc02b1cdd0.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/163/landscape_a7fb7d7e-41f0-456a-a27f-35fc02b1cdd0.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/163/square_a7fb7d7e-41f0-456a-a27f-35fc02b1cdd0.jpg","description":"","depth":2,"collapsed":true},"depth":2,"collapsed":true},{"image":{"id":164,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/164/thumb_3c9614f9-b161-4d56-967a-266ff3597252.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/164/medium_3c9614f9-b161-4d56-967a-266ff3597252.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/164/3c9614f9-b161-4d56-967a-266ff3597252.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/164/tower_3c9614f9-b161-4d56-967a-266ff3597252.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/164/landscape_3c9614f9-b161-4d56-967a-266ff3597252.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/164/square_3c9614f9-b161-4d56-967a-266ff3597252.jpg","description":"","depth":2,"collapsed":true},"depth":2,"collapsed":true}],"depth":2,"collapsed":true},{"id":101,"priority_index":6,"radius":100,"name":"Predjama Castle","description":"<p>Predjama Castle with its location and mysterious tunnels is truly something special. It impresses visitors with how well the natural cave and the man-made castle walls are interwoven, sometimes making it difficult to see where the former ends and the latter begin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the past, the castle provided the venue for the filming of several science documentaries and feature films. A few years ago, the castle was visited by a Discovery Channel team that was in search of any unexplained events and managed to capture a number of visual images and sounds that could not be quite clearly specified. In 1986, Predjama Castle was one of the filming locations of the film Armour of God with Jackie Chan in the starring role.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its picturesque interior and exterior would make a perfect venue for the filming of historical and fantasy films such as Harry Potter or Game of Thrones. In 2011, the castle was visited by the famous writer and screenwriter George R. R. Martin, and who knows when he might return to Predjama with a new screenplay in hand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The castle offers a unique insight into the construction techniques and ingenuity of medieval people who came here searching for a safe haven right at the entrance to the cave. During a siege in the 15th century, the castle offered refuge to its most famous and notorious owner - Erazem of Predjama. The appealing and inspiring legend about the brave robber baron Erazem, who had remained undefeated until he was betrayed by one of his servants, still lives on in the common lore, and rightly so as the gallant knight resisted the besiegers inside his safe castle for over a year without any major problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The karstic terrain beneath the castle with its cave system was an excellent choice. It provided Erazem and his people with a secret passage that lead to freedom, a source of drinking water, a further place for hiding and storage of food - everything that turned out to be indispensable, invaluable and essential during the siege.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Between May and September, visitors are also able to have a look around the picturesque Cave under Predjama Castle. Due to its location and favourable temperatures the cave is inhabited by a colony of bats, as a result of which visitors have no access to it during the bats' hibernation.</p>","url":"http://www.postojnska-jama.eu/en/come-and-visit-us/predjama-castle/","poi_type_id":3,"type_name":"Cool &

George's Cathedral","description":"<b>St. George's Cathedral</b>\r\n<p>Above the compact town centre reigns St. George's Cathedral, which gives the city its special character. It was probably built in the 12th century, but no exact data in this regard exists.</p>\r\n<p>In the 14th century, it was built to its present size. In the year 1344, on the Day of St. George, the cathedral was consecrated by nine bishops from near and far. It acquired its present appearance after Baroque renovation in the year 1637. The Bell Tower was completed in 1608, and the Baptistery in the year 1650. During these years, reinforcements were made to the hill on which the cathedral rests.</p>\r\n<p>The supporting walls were built in the year 1641, and on the sea side, the hill was fortified with stone arches. The construction of the stone arches began in the year 1663 and lasted until 1804. They were seriously dilapidated due to the effects of erosion, and thus had to be reconstructed and restored in 1998.</p>\r\n<p>In the year 1737, St George's Cathedral acquired seven marble altars. Of the preserved works of art, the two sculptures of St. George are particularly worth seeing. The larger one is from the 17th century and is the work of an unknown sculptor. The smaller one is silver-plated and was made by a Piran-based goldsmith's workshop. The wall paintings are the work of the Venetian school. The two big paintings (Mass in Bolsena and St. George's Miracle) date from the beginning of the 17th century and were painted by Angelo de Coster.</p>\r\n<b>St. George</b>\r\n<p>St. George is the patron saint of Piran. As a Christian prince and knight from Capadoccia, and a saint and martyr, he became a protector of many towns. Rarely is any saintly knight mentioned so frequently in legends and myths as he. Even the Dardanelles were once named the Straits of St. George. In England alone, one hundred and sixty churches are dedicated to this martyr.</p>\r\n<p>He is depicted as a mighty young man in his knightly outfit, on a white horse bearing his spear and a shield. The portrait of St. George on his horse, fighting a dragon, is one of the best known and frequently used motifs in Christianity.</p>\r\n<p>The Christian legend about St. George is based on the pagan tradition about the coming of the spring season. Therefore, the Day of St. George (24th April) denotes and symbolises the return of the spring, resurrection and forthcomingness. The most famous legend dealing with St. George was written in the medieval book \"Legenda aurea\" by Jacobo da Vortagine.</p>\r\n<b>Cathedral Organ</b>\r\n<p>Among the important pieces of the cathedral's property is the church organ, made by Petar Nakić, a Franciscan monk from Dalmatia. After his theology studies in Venice, he was trained in organ making and in the year 1729 completely dedicated himself to this craft. His organ in Piran was installed in the year 1746 and had 16 ranks. Unfortunately, it was damaged and had to go through a series of restorations.</p>\r\n<p>During World War I, it was severely damaged. All the larger pipes were removed to be melted into weapons. Almost 100 years before that, its keyboard in the manual was changed by A.V. Rossi from Trieste. In the year 1936, it was reconstructed by G. Bencz, but he did not restore the original disposition. In the year 1956, several adjustments were made by V. Rebolj, and so the set up of the organ today considerably varies from the original. The organ was cleaned in August 1995. And yet, through all these times, the organ continues to drone while giving great pleasure to many a music enthusiast.</p>\r\n<b>Bell Tower</b>\r\n<p>The Bell Tower (46.45 m), completed in the year 1608, is a smaller scale copy of San Marco Campanile in Venice, thus confirming that it was built during a period of Venetian influence in Piran.</p>\r\n<p>Among other newer bells, there is also a bell from the 15th century.</p>\r\n<p>During the summer months, you may climb the tower and admire the view of the entire Slovenian and Croatian Istria's nearby area, as well as the Italian coast, from Trieste to Duino, and from Tarvisio to Grado; on days of high northern winds, you can even see the Julian Alps and Dolomites.</p>\r\n<b>Baptistery</b>\r\n<p>The octagonal Baptistery was built in the year 1650 and is the last building of the new cathedral complex. In the church, one can find 17th-century furniture and a number of paintings from different periods.</p>\r\n<p>A great attraction is the large medieval Gothic crucifix, dating from that period around the year 1370. In the centre of the Baptistery, there is a Roman sarcophagus from the first half of the 2nd century A.D., at a later stage converted into a baptismal font.</p>","url":"http://www.portoroz.si/en/experience/cultural-sights/churches/st-george-cathedral","poi_type_id":1,"type_name":"Architecture","lon":"13.568448","lat":"45.529757","visit_duration":30,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/254/thumb_1efe8a96-1236-4e22-846c-2264e8230ccd.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/254/medium_1efe8a96-1236-4e22-846c-2264e8230ccd.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/254/1efe8a96-1236-4e22-846c-2264e8230ccd.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/254/tower_1efe8a96-1236-4e22-846c-2264e8230ccd.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/254/landscape_1efe8a96-1236-4e22-846c-2264e8230ccd.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/254/square_1efe8a96-1236-4e22-846c-2264e8230ccd.jpg","opening_hours":"N/A","tags":[{"tag_id":10,"name":"Church","category_id":1,"depth":2,"collapsed":true}],"details":{"wikipedia":"","facebook":"","twitter":"","youtube":"","instagram":"","pinterest":"","depth":2,"collapsed":true},"address":{"address1":"","city":"","post_code":"","country":"Slovenia","depth":2,"collapsed":true},"contact":{"name":"","email":"","telephone":"","fax":"","mobile":"","depth":2,"collapsed":true},"gallery":[{"image":{"id":254,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/254/thumb_1efe8a96-1236-4e22-846c-2264e8230ccd.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/254/medium_1efe8a96-1236-4e22-846c-2264e8230ccd.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/254/1efe8a96-1236-4e22-846c-2264e8230ccd.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/254/tower_1efe8a96-1236-4e22-846c-2264e8230ccd.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/254/landscape_1efe8a96-1236-4e22-846c-2264e8230ccd.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/254/square_1efe8a96-1236-4e22-846c-2264e8230ccd.jpg","description":"","depth":2,"collapsed":true},"depth":2,"collapsed":true},{"image":{"id":255,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/255/thumb_8ae035bc-ed71-4ac3-9a2b-5957c918d68c.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/255/medium_8ae035bc-ed71-4ac3-9a2b-5957c918d68c.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/255/8ae035bc-ed71-4ac3-9a2b-5957c918d68c.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/255/tower_8ae035bc-ed71-4ac3-9a2b-5957c918d68c.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/255/landscape_8ae035bc-ed71-4ac3-9a2b-5957c918d68c.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/255/square_8ae035bc-ed71-4ac3-9a2b-5957c918d68c.jpg","description":"","depth":2,"collapsed":true},"depth":2,"collapsed":true},{"image":{"id":256,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/256/thumb_1d6ea236-e9c5-4981-9708-43169cd012fd.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/256/medium_1d6ea236-e9c5-4981-9708-43169cd012fd.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/256/1d6ea236-e9c5-4981-9708-43169cd012fd.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/256/tower_1d6ea236-e9c5-4981-9708-43169cd012fd.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/256/landscape_1d6ea236-e9c5-4981-9708-43169cd012fd.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/256/square_1d6ea236-e9c5-4981-9708-43169cd012fd.jpg","description":"","depth":2,"collapsed":true},"depth":2,"collapsed":true}],"depth":2,"collapsed":true},{"id":82,"priority_index":4,"radius":50,"name":"Tartini Square","description":"<b>History of Tartini Square</b>\r\n<p>The place where Tartini Square is located today, was once a harbour for fishing boats of Piran.

St. Peter Church stood and still stands outside beyond the walls all alone since the year 1272. The church was restored in the year 1818. This work was entrusted to the architect Pietro Nobile, professor of the architecture department at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna and a court architecture counsellor, and to one of the most important sculptors of Classicism in Trieste, Antonio Boso.</p>\r\n<p>The Neo-Renaissance Town Hall building was designed and built during the years 1877–1879 by Givanni Righetti (1872–1901).</p>\r\n<p>During the years 1885–1891, Giuseppe Moso and Enrico Nordio supervised the construction of the new Court House on the western side of the square. In the year 1894, the harbour was filled in due to bad smell, filth and for health and sanitary reasons, and a large square was built in front of the new Town Hall and Court House buildings. With the introduction of the electric railway, which connected the town with Portorož and Lucija during the years 1909–1953, a roundabout of oval-shaped tracks was laid on the square. The pattern of that scheme is repeated in the design of the present oval-shaped platform, made of white marble and designed by architect Boris Podrecca on the occasion of the 300th anniversary Tartini's birth.</p>\r\n<b>Stone Flag Poles</b>\r\n<p>The poles were made in the 15th century and today they decorate the entrance to Tartini Square. Their original place was in front of the old Town Hall. On the first pole there is a relief of the winged lion of St. Mark. Underneath the Latin inscription reads the following:\"GAZE AT THE WINGED LION, WHICH GRASPS TERRITORIES, SEAS AND STARS\".</p>\r\n<p>On the right side, there are the coat of arms of old Piran and the Latin inscription: \"TO YOU, SEGREDO LUDOVICO, JUST PROTECTOR, IN HONOUR\". On the left side of the pole, there is the coat of arms of the Piran municipality, and under it are engraved the length measurements: \"PER pertica cca. 232 cm, PAS pasus cca. 190 cm, BRAZ viola cca. 68 cm, MAZ cca. 158 cm, STRO cca. 120 cm\". On special occasions, the Venetian flag used to be raised on these pillars.</p>\r\n<p>In the middle of the second pole, there is a relief of St. George, the town protector, on his horse. Underneath, there is the Latin inscription: \"WITH OUR PRAYERS, YOU REMAIN SAFE, THE LAND OF PIRAN\". On the right side of the pole, there is a chicken leg, the coat of arms of the Malipiero family. On the left side of the pole, there is an unknown coat of arms. The town flag (a red cross on a field of white – the symbol of St. George) used to be raised there.</p>","url":"http://www.portoroz.si/en/experience/cultural-sights/squares/tartini-square","poi_type_id":3,"type_name":"Cool &

Castle","description":"<p>Situated on an islet in the middle of the Krka River, the castle building, together with its park, paints one of the most picturesque images in the country and is a prominent cultural and natural monument. The first historical reference to the castle dates as far back as 1252, when it was part of the Lower Carniolan Freising estate, administered by the de Werde nobles, also known as islet knights. Over the centuries that followed the castle underwent architectural and ownership changes, passing from one noble family to another. Today the castle, restored to its original Gothic and Renaissance splendour, houses one of the most outstanding hotels in Slovenia – the Otočec Castle Hotel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The origins of the Otočec Castle are veiled in mystery since not much is known about who built it or when it was built. Its primary location is also mysterious for supposedly it used to be situated on the right bank of the Krka River. One of its later owners ordered a part of the estate on the right side of the castle to be dug out in order to increase its protection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Home to the de Werde noblemen in the 13th century, who were also known as the Knights of Otočec, this castle is the only one in Slovenia that sits on a river island. The magnificent castle on the river Krka was for centuries both a stronghold and a gracious home to numerous noble families. Its most prominent inhabitants, apart from the Knights of Otočec, were the Villanders nobles of Tyrol, captain of Žumberak Uskoks Ivan Lenkovič, and the noble Janez Sonce, who is also the central character in a narrative by Ivan Tavčar. Before World War II the castle was owned by the House of Marghieri de Commadona.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Medieval structure of the castle has changed in time, yet some of the architectural details were preserved and cannot be missed out on. One of the most important ones is the Renaissance portal dating back to the 16th century decorated with two marble medallions bearing maiden profiles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the beginning of World War II the castle was seized by the Italians and used as a fortress. In 1942, it was burnt by the Partisans and only ruins remained of the two bridges. Castle’s restoration began in 1952 with the restoration of the roof and lasted for six years, also with the help of international work brigades. In 1959, the first restaurant was opened in the restored castle. Over the next few decades the castle changed its appearance until it was restored to its original Gothic and Renaissance splendour as it houses one of the most outstanding hotels in Slovenia – the Otočec Castle Hotel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Otočec Castle is in addition to being the only castle situated on a river islet in Slovenia also the only one in the region of Dolenjska that was burnt down during the war and then restored.</p>","url":"http://www.grad-otocec.com/en/us/home/","poi_type_id":3,"type_name":"Cool & Unique","lon":"15.23525492","lat":"45.83800576","visit_duration":100,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/393/thumb_2cb38bf5-d5a5-46e3-a9ef-1efdcc2b6424.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/393/medium_2cb38bf5-d5a5-46e3-a9ef-1efdcc2b6424.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/393/2cb38bf5-d5a5-46e3-a9ef-1efdcc2b6424.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/393/tower_2cb38bf5-d5a5-46e3-a9ef-1efdcc2b6424.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/393/landscape_2cb38bf5-d5a5-46e3-a9ef-1efdcc2b6424.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/393/square_2cb38bf5-d5a5-46e3-a9ef-1efdcc2b6424.jpg","opening_hours":"N/A","tags":[{"tag_id":12,"name":"Castle","category_id":1,"depth":2,"collapsed":true},{"tag_id":16,"name":"Restaurant","category_id":4,"depth":2,"collapsed":true},{"tag_id":40,"name":"Golf","category_id":1,"depth":2,"collapsed":true}],"details":{"wikipedia":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oto%C4%8Dec_Castle","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/GradOtocec","twitter":"","youtube":"","instagram":"https://www.instagram.com/castleotocec/","pinterest":"","depth":2,"collapsed":true},"address":{"address1":"Grajska cesta 2","city":"Otočec ob Krki ","post_code":"8222","country":"Slovenia","depth":2,"collapsed":true},"contact":{"name":"","email":"booking@terme-krka.si","telephone":"+386 8 20 50 310","fax":"","mobile":"","depth":2,"collapsed":true},"gallery":[{"image":{"id":393,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/393/thumb_2cb38bf5-d5a5-46e3-a9ef-1efdcc2b6424.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/393/medium_2cb38bf5-d5a5-46e3-a9ef-1efdcc2b6424.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/393/2cb38bf5-d5a5-46e3-a9ef-1efdcc2b6424.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/393/tower_2cb38bf5-d5a5-46e3-a9ef-1efdcc2b6424.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/393/landscape_2cb38bf5-d5a5-46e3-a9ef-1efdcc2b6424.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/393/square_2cb38bf5-d5a5-46e3-a9ef-1efdcc2b6424.jpg","description":"","depth":2,"collapsed":true},"depth":2,"collapsed":true},{"image":{"id":394,"sort_index":2,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/394/thumb_c0d8d211-b388-44fa-ba0c-3e75ad662b19.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/394/medium_c0d8d211-b388-44fa-ba0c-3e75ad662b19.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/394/c0d8d211-b388-44fa-ba0c-3e75ad662b19.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/394/tower_c0d8d211-b388-44fa-ba0c-3e75ad662b19.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/394/landscape_c0d8d211-b388-44fa-ba0c-3e75ad662b19.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/394/square_c0d8d211-b388-44fa-ba0c-3e75ad662b19.jpg","description":"","depth":2,"collapsed":true},"depth":2,"collapsed":true},{"image":{"id":395,"sort_index":3,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/395/thumb_1fc8ef5e-0091-4d96-a16d-6701b6b72c7e.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/395/medium_1fc8ef5e-0091-4d96-a16d-6701b6b72c7e.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/395/1fc8ef5e-0091-4d96-a16d-6701b6b72c7e.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/395/tower_1fc8ef5e-0091-4d96-a16d-6701b6b72c7e.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/395/landscape_1fc8ef5e-0091-4d96-a16d-6701b6b72c7e.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/395/square_1fc8ef5e-0091-4d96-a16d-6701b6b72c7e.jpg","description":"","depth":2,"collapsed":true},"depth":2,"collapsed":true}],"depth":2,"collapsed":true},{"id":175,"priority_index":5,"radius":40,"name":"The Museum Of Dolenjska","description":"<p>The first idea of a museum that would collect material on the history of Novo mesto and Dolenjska was born in 1865, when the town celebrated its 500th anniversary. After several years of efforts by the Museum Society (founded in 1941) – an association of Dolenjska intellectuals, who started to systematically collect museum material – the long-awaited museum was finally founded in 1950, exactly 85 years after the first initiative. On 1 June 1950, the museum was handed over to the District People’s Committee Novo mesto by a decision of the People’s Committee of the Ljubljana government. Since then, that day has been considered the birthday of the Museum of Dolenjska. Every year, it is publicly celebrated with an Open Doors Day featuring diverse activities all day long, and – since 1996 – with the traditional exhibition From the depots of the Museum of Dolenjska.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first permanent exhibitions of the Museum of Dolenjska were opened in 1953 in the Križatija building, which has housed the museum since 1951. A general regional museum, the Museum of Dolenjska expanded and in the mid-1980s, it acquired its present form by including the remote facilities of Jakac House and Kočevski rog. Initially one building, the museum complex now comprises four buildings, not counting the remote facilities of Jakac House and Kočevski rog. Today, the museum comprises eight permanent exhibitions, five curatorial departments, an education department, and a restoration workshop for archaeological artefacts. The museum’s gallery and the central exhibition area house large temporary exhibitions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With its rich and diverse exhibition program, research and publishing activities, as well as the diverse and systematic educational work, the museum is a valuable cultural and artistic centre of Novo mesto.</p>","url":"http://www.dolenjskimuzej.si/en/","poi_type_id":2,"type_name":"Art & Museums","lon":"15.16810428","lat":"45.80311968","visit_duration":100,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/396/thumb_0b588751-124f-4143-8619-941a9933801a.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/396/medium_0b588751-124f-4143-8619-941a9933801a.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/396/0b588751-124f-4143-8619-941a9933801a.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/396/tower_0b588751-124f-4143-8619-941a9933801a.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/396/landscape_0b588751-124f-4143-8619-941a9933801a.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/396/square_0b588751-124f-4143-8619-941a9933801a.jpg","opening_hours":"N/A","tags":[{"tag_id":19,"name":"Gallery","category_id":2,"depth":2,"collapsed":true}],"details":{"wikipedia":"","facebook":"https://sl-si.facebook.com/pages/Dolenjski-muzej-Novo-mesto/160301777376917","twitter":"https://twitter.com/DolenjskiMuzej","youtube":"","instagram":"","pinterest":"","depth":2,"collapsed":true},"address":{"address1":"Muzejska ulica 7","city":"Novo Mesto","post_code":"8000","country":"Slovenia","depth":2,"collapsed":true},"contact":{"name":"","email":"dolenjski.muzej@dolenjskimuzej.si","telephone":"+386 (0) 7 373 11 11","fax":"+386 (0) 7 373 11 12","mobile":"","depth":2,"collapsed":true},"gallery":[{"image":{"id":396,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/396/thumb_0b588751-124f-4143-8619-941a9933801a.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/396/medium_0b588751-124f-4143-8619-941a9933801a.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/396/0b588751-124f-4143-8619-941a9933801a.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/396/tower_0b588751-124f-4143-8619-941a9933801a.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/396/landscape_0b588751-124f-4143-8619-941a9933801a.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/396/square_0b588751-124f-4143-8619-941a9933801a.jpg","description":"Bronze Figurally Decorated Situlae.

Of course we're no exception, as we still remember the fog shrouded photo we snapped on our first trip to the city way back in the forgotten days of analogue film. More recently some amateur artiste apparently felt that the mythical beasts were lacking a certain je ne sais quoi and took it upon themself to add a smattering of red paint to their mouths and claws.

Small and interesting, but not too exciting at first glance, a longer look at its history and finer details reveals its hidden charm and beauty. Built on the site of a much earlier church, the cathedral’s main structure and appearance dates from the first half of the 18th century. Inside the Baroque masterpiece is a cavalcade of classic creams and golds, littered with extraordinarily detailed frescoes and possessing that calming feeling that only a great church can bring. Of particular interest are the ornate choir stalls and Robba’s maginficent angels on the main altar. Don’t forget to check out the astonishing pair of bronze doors on the western and southern sides.

Memorial pillars along it mark the locations of bunkers from the war, and information broads keep the walker informed about what happened here.

Due to the quality and unique design of Rogaška's masterpieces, the workshop received a Five Star Diamond Award twice – in 2007 and in 2008 – awarded by The American Academy of Hospitality Sciences.","url":"http://www.steklarna-rogaska.si/en","poi_type_id":8,"type_name":"Shopping","lon":"14.506435","lat":"46.049637","visit_duration":30,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/69/thumb_fa98d209-4f85-4501-a6ba-c41b7afe3b2c.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/69/medium_fa98d209-4f85-4501-a6ba-c41b7afe3b2c.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/69/fa98d209-4f85-4501-a6ba-c41b7afe3b2c.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/69/tower_fa98d209-4f85-4501-a6ba-c41b7afe3b2c.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/69/landscape_fa98d209-4f85-4501-a6ba-c41b7afe3b2c.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/69/square_fa98d209-4f85-4501-a6ba-c41b7afe3b2c.jpg","opening_hours":"Wed 09:00-20:00","details":{"wikipedia":"","facebook":"","twitter":"","youtube":"","instagram":"","pinterest":""},"address":{"address1":"Mestni trg 22","city":"Ljubljana","post_code":"1000","country":"Slovenia"},"contact":{"name":"","email":"prodajalna.ljubljana@stek-rogaska.si","telephone":"+386 (0)1 24 12 701","fax":"","mobile":""},"gallery":[{"image":{"id":69,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/69/thumb_fa98d209-4f85-4501-a6ba-c41b7afe3b2c.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/69/medium_fa98d209-4f85-4501-a6ba-c41b7afe3b2c.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/69/fa98d209-4f85-4501-a6ba-c41b7afe3b2c.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/69/tower_fa98d209-4f85-4501-a6ba-c41b7afe3b2c.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/69/landscape_fa98d209-4f85-4501-a6ba-c41b7afe3b2c.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/69/square_fa98d209-4f85-4501-a6ba-c41b7afe3b2c.jpg","description":""}},{"image":{"id":70,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/70/thumb_3d41ffef-8729-4971-b7ae-47e6dd0bbaca.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/70/medium_3d41ffef-8729-4971-b7ae-47e6dd0bbaca.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/70/3d41ffef-8729-4971-b7ae-47e6dd0bbaca.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/70/tower_3d41ffef-8729-4971-b7ae-47e6dd0bbaca.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/70/landscape_3d41ffef-8729-4971-b7ae-47e6dd0bbaca.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/70/square_3d41ffef-8729-4971-b7ae-47e6dd0bbaca.jpg","description":""}}]},{"id":36,"priority_index":3,"radius":15,"name":"Marjeta Grošelj Handbags","description":"Marjeta Grošelj has been creating handbags for over four decades.

It is located in the very city centre and covers the area between the Triple Bridge and the Dragon Bridge. The market areas are located at the Vodnikov trg Square, Pogačarjev trg Square and Dolničarjeva ulica Street, while trading is also carried out at the Plečnik’s Arcades and in the indoor market (the theological seminary building). The market operates with its own routine cycles: weekly, monthly, yearly and, most importantly, daily. Every morning retailers fill the market with various goods placed on view at booths and stalls, trading carts, display cases, kiosks, etc. The Central Market has its charm in every season. In the first days of spring, the market offers the first vegetables and flowers. In the summer, when visitors buy fresh fruits and vegetables, they like to rest in the shade and cool down with a drink. In the autumn people like to buy goods for winter storage.

Hotel CUBO is housed in a historic, protected building that has been enriched with a fresh, modern design to create an impressive contrast. We have always been aware of the fact that an excellent location, spacious rooms and select furnishings represent only a part of what a superior hotel must offer its guests. At CUBO, service comes first, and this is why we focus intensively on staff and their willingness to perform with excellence, dedication and heart, all the while welcoming our guests as if they have just arrived to our staff members’ own homes. Give us the pleasure of welcoming you to our hotel, and give yourself the opportunity to experience Slovenian hospitality first-hand.

George's Cathedral","description":"<b>St. George's Cathedral</b>\r\n<p>Above the compact town centre reigns St. George's Cathedral, which gives the city its special character. It was probably built in the 12th century, but no exact data in this regard exists.</p>\r\n<p>In the 14th century, it was built to its present size. In the year 1344, on the Day of St. George, the cathedral was consecrated by nine bishops from near and far. It acquired its present appearance after Baroque renovation in the year 1637. The Bell Tower was completed in 1608, and the Baptistery in the year 1650. During these years, reinforcements were made to the hill on which the cathedral rests.</p>\r\n<p>The supporting walls were built in the year 1641, and on the sea side, the hill was fortified with stone arches. The construction of the stone arches began in the year 1663 and lasted until 1804. They were seriously dilapidated due to the effects of erosion, and thus had to be reconstructed and restored in 1998.</p>\r\n<p>In the year 1737, St George's Cathedral acquired seven marble altars. Of the preserved works of art, the two sculptures of St. George are particularly worth seeing. The larger one is from the 17th century and is the work of an unknown sculptor. The smaller one is silver-plated and was made by a Piran-based goldsmith's workshop. The wall paintings are the work of the Venetian school. The two big paintings (Mass in Bolsena and St. George's Miracle) date from the beginning of the 17th century and were painted by Angelo de Coster.</p>\r\n<b>St. George</b>\r\n<p>St. George is the patron saint of Piran. As a Christian prince and knight from Capadoccia, and a saint and martyr, he became a protector of many towns. Rarely is any saintly knight mentioned so frequently in legends and myths as he. Even the Dardanelles were once named the Straits of St. George. In England alone, one hundred and sixty churches are dedicated to this martyr.</p>\r\n<p>He is depicted as a mighty young man in his knightly outfit, on a white horse bearing his spear and a shield. The portrait of St. George on his horse, fighting a dragon, is one of the best known and frequently used motifs in Christianity.</p>\r\n<p>The Christian legend about St. George is based on the pagan tradition about the coming of the spring season. Therefore, the Day of St. George (24th April) denotes and symbolises the return of the spring, resurrection and forthcomingness. The most famous legend dealing with St. George was written in the medieval book \"Legenda aurea\" by Jacobo da Vortagine.</p>\r\n<b>Cathedral Organ</b>\r\n<p>Among the important pieces of the cathedral's property is the church organ, made by Petar Nakić, a Franciscan monk from Dalmatia. After his theology studies in Venice, he was trained in organ making and in the year 1729 completely dedicated himself to this craft. His organ in Piran was installed in the year 1746 and had 16 ranks. Unfortunately, it was damaged and had to go through a series of restorations.</p>\r\n<p>During World War I, it was severely damaged. All the larger pipes were removed to be melted into weapons. Almost 100 years before that, its keyboard in the manual was changed by A.V. Rossi from Trieste. In the year 1936, it was reconstructed by G. Bencz, but he did not restore the original disposition. In the year 1956, several adjustments were made by V. Rebolj, and so the set up of the organ today considerably varies from the original. The organ was cleaned in August 1995. And yet, through all these times, the organ continues to drone while giving great pleasure to many a music enthusiast.</p>\r\n<b>Bell Tower</b>\r\n<p>The Bell Tower (46.45 m), completed in the year 1608, is a smaller scale copy of San Marco Campanile in Venice, thus confirming that it was built during a period of Venetian influence in Piran.</p>\r\n<p>Among other newer bells, there is also a bell from the 15th century.</p>\r\n<p>During the summer months, you may climb the tower and admire the view of the entire Slovenian and Croatian Istria's nearby area, as well as the Italian coast, from Trieste to Duino, and from Tarvisio to Grado; on days of high northern winds, you can even see the Julian Alps and Dolomites.</p>\r\n<b>Baptistery</b>\r\n<p>The octagonal Baptistery was built in the year 1650 and is the last building of the new cathedral complex. In the church, one can find 17th-century furniture and a number of paintings from different periods.</p>\r\n<p>A great attraction is the large medieval Gothic crucifix, dating from that period around the year 1370. In the centre of the Baptistery, there is a Roman sarcophagus from the first half of the 2nd century A.D., at a later stage converted into a baptismal font.</p>","url":"http://www.portoroz.si/en/experience/cultural-sights/churches/st-george-cathedral","poi_type_id":1,"type_name":"Architecture","lon":"13.568448","lat":"45.529757","visit_duration":30,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/254/thumb_1efe8a96-1236-4e22-846c-2264e8230ccd.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/254/medium_1efe8a96-1236-4e22-846c-2264e8230ccd.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/254/1efe8a96-1236-4e22-846c-2264e8230ccd.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/254/tower_1efe8a96-1236-4e22-846c-2264e8230ccd.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/254/landscape_1efe8a96-1236-4e22-846c-2264e8230ccd.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/254/square_1efe8a96-1236-4e22-846c-2264e8230ccd.jpg","opening_hours":"N/A","tags":[{"tag_id":10,"name":"Church","category_id":1}],"details":{"wikipedia":"","facebook":"","twitter":"","youtube":"","instagram":"","pinterest":""},"address":{"address1":"","city":"","post_code":"","country":"Slovenia"},"contact":{"name":"","email":"","telephone":"","fax":"","mobile":""},"gallery":[{"image":{"id":254,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/254/thumb_1efe8a96-1236-4e22-846c-2264e8230ccd.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/254/medium_1efe8a96-1236-4e22-846c-2264e8230ccd.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/254/1efe8a96-1236-4e22-846c-2264e8230ccd.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/254/tower_1efe8a96-1236-4e22-846c-2264e8230ccd.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/254/landscape_1efe8a96-1236-4e22-846c-2264e8230ccd.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/254/square_1efe8a96-1236-4e22-846c-2264e8230ccd.jpg","description":""}},{"image":{"id":255,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/255/thumb_8ae035bc-ed71-4ac3-9a2b-5957c918d68c.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/255/medium_8ae035bc-ed71-4ac3-9a2b-5957c918d68c.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/255/8ae035bc-ed71-4ac3-9a2b-5957c918d68c.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/255/tower_8ae035bc-ed71-4ac3-9a2b-5957c918d68c.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/255/landscape_8ae035bc-ed71-4ac3-9a2b-5957c918d68c.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/255/square_8ae035bc-ed71-4ac3-9a2b-5957c918d68c.jpg","description":""}},{"image":{"id":256,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/256/thumb_1d6ea236-e9c5-4981-9708-43169cd012fd.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/256/medium_1d6ea236-e9c5-4981-9708-43169cd012fd.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/256/1d6ea236-e9c5-4981-9708-43169cd012fd.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/256/tower_1d6ea236-e9c5-4981-9708-43169cd012fd.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/256/landscape_1d6ea236-e9c5-4981-9708-43169cd012fd.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/256/square_1d6ea236-e9c5-4981-9708-43169cd012fd.jpg","description":""}}]},{"id":82,"priority_index":4,"radius":50,"name":"Tartini Square","description":"<b>History of Tartini Square</b>\r\n<p>The place where Tartini Square is located today, was once a harbour for fishing boats of Piran. The harbour used to be outside the town walls, because the oldest, partly preserved walls propagated behind the present Town Hall. St. Peter Church stood and still stands outside beyond the walls all alone since the year 1272. The church was restored in the year 1818. This work was entrusted to the architect Pietro Nobile, professor of the architecture department at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna and a court architecture counsellor, and to one of the most important sculptors of Classicism in Trieste, Antonio Boso.</p>\r\n<p>The Neo-Renaissance Town Hall building was designed and built during the years 1877–1879 by Givanni Righetti (1872–1901).</p>\r\n<p>During the years 1885–1891, Giuseppe Moso and Enrico Nordio supervised the construction of the new Court House on the western side of the square. In the year 1894, the harbour was filled in due to bad smell, filth and for health and sanitary reasons, and a large square was built in front of the new Town Hall and Court House buildings. With the introduction of the electric railway, which connected the town with Portorož and Lucija during the years 1909–1953, a roundabout of oval-shaped tracks was laid on the square. The pattern of that scheme is repeated in the design of the present oval-shaped platform, made of white marble and designed by architect Boris Podrecca on the occasion of the 300th anniversary Tartini's birth.</p>\r\n<b>Stone Flag Poles</b>\r\n<p>The poles were made in the 15th century and today they decorate the entrance to Tartini Square. Their original place was in front of the old Town Hall. On the first pole there is a relief of the winged lion of St. Mark. Underneath the Latin inscription reads the following:\"GAZE AT THE WINGED LION, WHICH GRASPS TERRITORIES, SEAS AND STARS\".</p>\r\n<p>On the right side, there are the coat of arms of old Piran and the Latin inscription: \"TO YOU, SEGREDO LUDOVICO, JUST PROTECTOR, IN HONOUR\". On the left side of the pole, there is the coat of arms of the Piran municipality, and under it are engraved the length measurements: \"PER pertica cca. 232 cm, PAS pasus cca. 190 cm, BRAZ viola cca. 68 cm, MAZ cca. 158 cm, STRO cca. 120 cm\". On special occasions, the Venetian flag used to be raised on these pillars.</p>\r\n<p>In the middle of the second pole, there is a relief of St. George, the town protector, on his horse.

It represents a symbol of Slovene partisan health care and bears witness to incredible humanity and self-sacrifice of the health care and other personnel taking care of the wounded. The complex of the Franja Partisan Hospital is comprised of 14 wooden barracks and several auxiliary facilities. They were gradually built in the narrow, difficult to access Pasica gorge in Dolenji Novaki near Cerkno. The construction lasted from December 1943 to May 1945. The hospital was named after a partisan doctor, Dr. Franja Bojc Bidovec, who shortly after the hospital was established, took on the function of its administrator.<p/><p>The Franja Partisan Hospital was among the best equipped secret patizan hospitals with an operating room, X-ray, disability ward and even electricity plant.<p/><p>It could admit up to 100 wounded and provided treatment for a total of 578 persons, especially seriously wounded. The hospital also included several dislocated wards for lightly wounded. All wards provided treatment to about 900 wounded of various nationalities.<p/><p>The Franja Partisan Hospital is a cultural monument of national importance, is entered in UNESCO's Tentative List of World Heritage, and bears the European Heritage Label. After the disastrous flood that occurred in September 2007, the monument has been reconstructed almost in its entirety, and is reopened for visitors from May 2010. Despite the loss of authentic tangible heritage, it has remained a symbol of international alliance and resistance, and above all a precious reminder of humanity, nobleness, and comradeship.<p/>","url":"http://www.turizem-cerkno.si/en/sights/partizanska-bolnica-franja.html","poi_type_id":2,"type_name":"Art & Museums","lon":"14.02826628","lat":"46.15390248","visit_duration":120,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/119/thumb_7ce363a0-674a-4ce1-9628-480fcc525e50.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/119/medium_7ce363a0-674a-4ce1-9628-480fcc525e50.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/119/7ce363a0-674a-4ce1-9628-480fcc525e50.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/119/tower_7ce363a0-674a-4ce1-9628-480fcc525e50.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/119/landscape_7ce363a0-674a-4ce1-9628-480fcc525e50.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/119/square_7ce363a0-674a-4ce1-9628-480fcc525e50.jpg","opening_hours":"N/A","details":{"wikipedia":"https://sl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenska_vojna_partizanska_bolnica_Franja","facebook":"","twitter":"","youtube":"","instagram":"","pinterest":""},"address":{"address1":"Dolenji Novaki pri Cerknem","city":"Cerkno","post_code":"5282","country":"Slovenia"},"contact":{"name":"","email":"Info@Turizem-Cerkno.Si","telephone":"+386 (0)5 373 46 45","fax":"","mobile":"+386 (0)51 378 415"},"gallery":[{"image":{"id":119,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/119/thumb_7ce363a0-674a-4ce1-9628-480fcc525e50.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/119/medium_7ce363a0-674a-4ce1-9628-480fcc525e50.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/119/7ce363a0-674a-4ce1-9628-480fcc525e50.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/119/tower_7ce363a0-674a-4ce1-9628-480fcc525e50.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/119/landscape_7ce363a0-674a-4ce1-9628-480fcc525e50.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/119/square_7ce363a0-674a-4ce1-9628-480fcc525e50.jpg","description":"Franja Partisan Hospital"}},{"image":{"id":120,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/120/thumb_3fdf0ff3-7afe-463a-8e6e-daaa2cd2360f.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/120/medium_3fdf0ff3-7afe-463a-8e6e-daaa2cd2360f.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/120/3fdf0ff3-7afe-463a-8e6e-daaa2cd2360f.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/120/tower_3fdf0ff3-7afe-463a-8e6e-daaa2cd2360f.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/120/landscape_3fdf0ff3-7afe-463a-8e6e-daaa2cd2360f.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/120/square_3fdf0ff3-7afe-463a-8e6e-daaa2cd2360f.jpg","description":"Gorge Pasice"}},{"image":{"id":121,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/121/thumb_87f2004c-a7ca-4bea-85cc-72b17be461fd.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/121/medium_87f2004c-a7ca-4bea-85cc-72b17be461fd.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/121/87f2004c-a7ca-4bea-85cc-72b17be461fd.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/121/tower_87f2004c-a7ca-4bea-85cc-72b17be461fd.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/121/landscape_87f2004c-a7ca-4bea-85cc-72b17be461fd.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/121/square_87f2004c-a7ca-4bea-85cc-72b17be461fd.jpg","description":""}},{"image":{"id":122,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/122/thumb_b0aa65ff-84c8-427f-ab9e-fb33937bea1d.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/122/medium_b0aa65ff-84c8-427f-ab9e-fb33937bea1d.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/122/b0aa65ff-84c8-427f-ab9e-fb33937bea1d.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/122/tower_b0aa65ff-84c8-427f-ab9e-fb33937bea1d.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/122/landscape_b0aa65ff-84c8-427f-ab9e-fb33937bea1d.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/122/square_b0aa65ff-84c8-427f-ab9e-fb33937bea1d.jpg","description":""}},{"image":{"id":123,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/123/thumb_7199bfec-6118-4963-8d89-af14180d83cf.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/123/medium_7199bfec-6118-4963-8d89-af14180d83cf.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/123/7199bfec-6118-4963-8d89-af14180d83cf.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/123/tower_7199bfec-6118-4963-8d89-af14180d83cf.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/123/landscape_7199bfec-6118-4963-8d89-af14180d83cf.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/123/square_7199bfec-6118-4963-8d89-af14180d83cf.jpg","description":""}}]},{"id":87,"priority_index":5,"radius":30,"name":"National Museum Of Contemporary History","description":"If you needed a reason to visit Tivoli Park, it's here.

In a period of rapid urban expansion following the first World War, the Ljubljana city council made the decision to tear down the last remaining section of the walls so they could sell off the land for development and alleviate traffic congestion. However, thanks largely to the efforts of France Stelé, who was then head of the city's monuments office, there was a public outcry against the proposal, leading the council to reverse its decision and restore the walls.</p><p>The design of the restoration works was awarded to famed Slovene architect Jože Plečnik in 1926, and although his blending of modern and classical elements are now considered one of the Ljubljana's top attractions, at the time it proved quite controversial and the project was not completed until 1934.

While a small neoclassical arcade was initially built and quite a few tombs were in fact relocated, the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia indefinitely postponed the plans, which were then abandoned altogether in the years following the war.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After decades of neglect, the cemetery was finally renovated in the early 1990s, and nowadays the long, narrow, tree-filled space is squeezed between a newly built park and some nondescript commercial buildings. But concealed behind it's walls are the final resting places of some notable Slovenes, including Linhart, Vodnik, Čop, Levstik, Stritar and Aškerc - all of which should sound familiar even to non-historians who have paid attention to the place names on a map of Ljubljana.

Postojna Cave","description":"<p>The Postojna Cave is a system of 20 kilometres of passages, galleries, and chambers, which have been visited by over 33 million visitors accompanied by experienced guides over almost two hundred years. At the same time it is the largest Classical Karst cave and the most visited cave in Europe. Already in 1872, railway tracks were installed in the cave, and in 1884, electricity was also installed. Today, visitors can satisfy their curiosity by learning about the origin of the caves, by examining the passages and chambers, and especially by observing the rising stalagmites or hanging stalactites, the joining columns, the creasing curtains, and the strings of endless fantastic shapes. The cave is easily accessible and has no steps or steep inclines; part of the cave is viewed from the train, and the rest can be observed on foot. The Postojna Cave is also considered the birthplace of speleobiology. The Postojna-Planina cave system is the home of as many as 85 completely adapted animal species, making it the world’s largest cave ecosystem, and the crown jewel of biological diversity. The most famous inhabitant is of course the olm, or the human fish (Proteus anguinus).</p>","url":"http://www.postojnska-jama.eu/en/home/","poi_type_id":12,"type_name":"Nature","lon":"14.20363953","lat":"45.78260137","visit_duration":120,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/161/thumb_64ef0b3f-605a-4b00-b61a-70924277b305.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/161/medium_64ef0b3f-605a-4b00-b61a-70924277b305.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/161/64ef0b3f-605a-4b00-b61a-70924277b305.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/161/tower_64ef0b3f-605a-4b00-b61a-70924277b305.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/161/landscape_64ef0b3f-605a-4b00-b61a-70924277b305.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/161/square_64ef0b3f-605a-4b00-b61a-70924277b305.jpg","opening_hours":"N/A","tags":[{"tag_id":28,"name":"Cave","category_id":12}],"details":{"wikipedia":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postojna_Cave","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/PostojnaCave/","twitter":"","youtube":"","instagram":"","pinterest":""},"address":{"address1":"Jamska cesta 30","city":"Postojna","post_code":"6230","country":"Slovenia"},"contact":{"name":"","email":"info@postojnska-jama.eu","telephone":"+386 5 700 01 00","fax":"+386 5 700 01 30","mobile":""},"gallery":[{"image":{"id":161,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/161/thumb_64ef0b3f-605a-4b00-b61a-70924277b305.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/161/medium_64ef0b3f-605a-4b00-b61a-70924277b305.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/161/64ef0b3f-605a-4b00-b61a-70924277b305.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/161/tower_64ef0b3f-605a-4b00-b61a-70924277b305.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/161/landscape_64ef0b3f-605a-4b00-b61a-70924277b305.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/161/square_64ef0b3f-605a-4b00-b61a-70924277b305.jpg","description":""}},{"image":{"id":162,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/162/thumb_e1712cb8-7999-4ef0-adaa-d24b6af9b4c8.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/162/medium_e1712cb8-7999-4ef0-adaa-d24b6af9b4c8.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/162/e1712cb8-7999-4ef0-adaa-d24b6af9b4c8.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/162/tower_e1712cb8-7999-4ef0-adaa-d24b6af9b4c8.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/162/landscape_e1712cb8-7999-4ef0-adaa-d24b6af9b4c8.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/162/square_e1712cb8-7999-4ef0-adaa-d24b6af9b4c8.jpg","description":""}},{"image":{"id":163,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/163/thumb_a7fb7d7e-41f0-456a-a27f-35fc02b1cdd0.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/163/medium_a7fb7d7e-41f0-456a-a27f-35fc02b1cdd0.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/163/a7fb7d7e-41f0-456a-a27f-35fc02b1cdd0.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/163/tower_a7fb7d7e-41f0-456a-a27f-35fc02b1cdd0.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/163/landscape_a7fb7d7e-41f0-456a-a27f-35fc02b1cdd0.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/163/square_a7fb7d7e-41f0-456a-a27f-35fc02b1cdd0.jpg","description":""}},{"image":{"id":164,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/164/thumb_3c9614f9-b161-4d56-967a-266ff3597252.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/164/medium_3c9614f9-b161-4d56-967a-266ff3597252.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/164/3c9614f9-b161-4d56-967a-266ff3597252.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/164/tower_3c9614f9-b161-4d56-967a-266ff3597252.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/164/landscape_3c9614f9-b161-4d56-967a-266ff3597252.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/164/square_3c9614f9-b161-4d56-967a-266ff3597252.jpg","description":""}}]},{"id":101,"priority_index":6,"radius":100,"name":"Predjama Castle","description":"<p>Predjama Castle with its location and mysterious tunnels is truly something special. It impresses visitors with how well the natural cave and the man-made castle walls are interwoven, sometimes making it difficult to see where the former ends and the latter begin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the past, the castle provided the venue for the filming of several science documentaries and feature films. A few years ago, the castle was visited by a Discovery Channel team that was in search of any unexplained events and managed to capture a number of visual images and sounds that could not be quite clearly specified. In 1986, Predjama Castle was one of the filming locations of the film Armour of God with Jackie Chan in the starring role.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its picturesque interior and exterior would make a perfect venue for the filming of historical and fantasy films such as Harry Potter or Game of Thrones. In 2011, the castle was visited by the famous writer and screenwriter George R. R. Martin, and who knows when he might return to Predjama with a new screenplay in hand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The castle offers a unique insight into the construction techniques and ingenuity of medieval people who came here searching for a safe haven right at the entrance to the cave. During a siege in the 15th century, the castle offered refuge to its most famous and notorious owner - Erazem of Predjama. The appealing and inspiring legend about the brave robber baron Erazem, who had remained undefeated until he was betrayed by one of his servants, still lives on in the common lore, and rightly so as the gallant knight resisted the besiegers inside his safe castle for over a year without any major problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The karstic terrain beneath the castle with its cave system was an excellent choice. It provided Erazem and his people with a secret passage that lead to freedom, a source of drinking water, a further place for hiding and storage of food - everything that turned out to be indispensable, invaluable and essential during the siege.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Between May and September, visitors are also able to have a look around the picturesque Cave under Predjama Castle. Due to its location and favourable temperatures the cave is inhabited by a colony of bats, as a result of which visitors have no access to it during the bats' hibernation.</p>","url":"http://www.postojnska-jama.eu/en/come-and-visit-us/predjama-castle/","poi_type_id":3,"type_name":"Cool & Unique","lon":"14.12707462","lat":"45.81572721","visit_duration":90,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/165/thumb_5e3ce46e-4d4e-4a54-9ab3-95346fbf4942.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/165/medium_5e3ce46e-4d4e-4a54-9ab3-95346fbf4942.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/165/5e3ce46e-4d4e-4a54-9ab3-95346fbf4942.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/165/tower_5e3ce46e-4d4e-4a54-9ab3-95346fbf4942.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/165/landscape_5e3ce46e-4d4e-4a54-9ab3-95346fbf4942.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/165/square_5e3ce46e-4d4e-4a54-9ab3-95346fbf4942.jpg","opening_hours":"N/A","tags":[{"tag_id":12,"name":"Castle","category_id":1}],"details":{"wikipedia":"","facebook":"","twitter":"","youtube":"","instagram":"","pinterest":""},"address":{"address1":"Predjama 1","city":"Postojna","post_code":"6230","country":"Slovenia"},"contact":{"name":"","email":"sales@postojnska-jama.eu","telephone":"+386 5 700 01 00","fax":"+386 5 700 01 30","mobile":""},"gallery":[{"image":{"id":165,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/165/thumb_5e3ce46e-4d4e-4a54-9ab3-95346fbf4942.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/165/medium_5e3ce46e-4d4e-4a54-9ab3-95346fbf4942.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/165/5e3ce46e-4d4e-4a54-9ab3-95346fbf4942.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/165/tower_5e3ce46e-4d4e-4a54-9ab3-95346fbf4942.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/165/landscape_5e3ce46e-4d4e-4a54-9ab3-95346fbf4942.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/165/square_5e3ce46e-4d4e-4a54-9ab3-95346fbf4942.jpg","description":""}},{"image":{"id":166,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/166/thumb_cc0006d0-4969-477c-bd81-8ca25b41eb8c.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/166/medium_cc0006d0-4969-477c-bd81-8ca25b41eb8c.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/166/cc0006d0-4969-477c-bd81-8ca25b41eb8c.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/166/tower_cc0006d0-4969-477c-bd81-8ca25b41eb8c.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/166/landscape_cc0006d0-4969-477c-bd81-8ca25b41eb8c.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/166/square_cc0006d0-4969-477c-bd81-8ca25b41eb8c.jpg","description":""}},{"image":{"id":167,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/167/thumb_da18365a-1b3a-4cfd-a159-fed166a9558d.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/167/medium_da18365a-1b3a-4cfd-a159-fed166a9558d.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/167/da18365a-1b3a-4cfd-a159-fed166a9558d.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/167/tower_da18365a-1b3a-4cfd-a159-fed166a9558d.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/167/landscape_da18365a-1b3a-4cfd-a159-fed166a9558d.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/167/square_da18365a-1b3a-4cfd-a159-fed166a9558d.jpg","description":""}},{"image":{"id":168,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/168/thumb_acac3ef9-de61-4122-b3a2-87c275d73447.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/168/medium_acac3ef9-de61-4122-b3a2-87c275d73447.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/168/acac3ef9-de61-4122-b3a2-87c275d73447.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/168/tower_acac3ef9-de61-4122-b3a2-87c275d73447.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/168/landscape_acac3ef9-de61-4122-b3a2-87c275d73447.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/168/square_acac3ef9-de61-4122-b3a2-87c275d73447.jpg","description":""}}]},{"id":102,"priority_index":4,"radius":30,"name":"Beekeeping Farm Museum","description":"<p>Years ago beekeepers bred bee colonies in wicker baskets, but today wooden crates placed in wooden frames with honeycomb are used instead.

Krvavec is also the most easily accessible ski slope of the Slovenian Alps and the nearest to Ljubljana, with frequent flight connections to Paris and London. In the winter it attracts skiers, and in the summer it offers many opportunities for hiking or cycling tours. Skiers and travelers are attracted by the untouched nature of Krvavec with its beautiful outlooks onto neighbouring ridges, and its fantastic genuine local food.</p><p>Most Slovenians believe that Krvavec only provides good skiing and winter adventures, however there is much more to it than that. Its warm hiking face can be seen throughout the spring, summer and autumn months.</p><p>Krvavec is the nearest ski resort to Ljubljana (25km away) and Kranj (17km away), and also a pleasant mountain trekking point. Krvavec is the top mountain of the Kališko ridge, which is linked to the main axis of the Kamnik Alps.</p><p>What was formerly a glacier has shaped around the slope of Krvavec, so over time the sparse trees and dwarf pine have been cut and Alpine meadows have been created around the mountain peak. The peaks main identification point is the RTV Slovenia iron concrete transmission tower, which in the eighties replaced the metal tower, which had been built into the hillside in 1955.</p><p>The cable car and cable airway Gospinc operates throughout summer, which takes you to the home of Krvavec. Alpine meadows and ridges around Krvavec are very comfortable for walking and are extremely scenic locations in the Ljubljana basin. After embracing the nature, views, hiking and adrenaline pumping excitement of Krvavec, you can settle down for a true gourmet experience, and enjoy many domestic culinary specialities such as; buckwheat, sour milk, sausages, blood sausage with sauerkraut, dry and semi-dry sausages, roast beef, mush, maselnek, homemade bread and delicious stews.</p><p>Tours from the mountain lodge at Gopsinec, which is close to the upper cable car station:</p><p>• Veliki Zvon – 1971 m and one hours walk</p><p>• The top of Koren – 1999 m and a good two hours walk</p><p>• Kalški greben – 2224 m and a three and a half hours walk</p><p>• Over the Kalški greben or Dolge njive to Cojzov's hut on the Kokriška sedlo (saddle) (1973 m) – between five and six hours walk</p><p>The beautiful nature, unique views, medicinal herbs and tours are among many reasons to visit Krvavec in the summer. Since Krvavec is a higher level above the sea, its pastures were transformed into ski slopes. The renewed cable car (with panoramic cars for 6 people) carries up to 2000 people every hour to the central mountain ski resort at the passage of the Kamnik Alps. There are approximately 106 hectares of ski area available to visitors between the upper cable car station at Gospinec (1450m) and the highest point of the ski slopes at Zvoh (1971 m). In the lower part of Krvavec on the Kriška planina, there is also a 5 km long track specially set aside for walking and cross country skiing.</p><p>Because of its beauty and purity, Krvavec is perfect for summer hiking and winter skiing, with a complex of slopers at an altitude of between 1450m and 1971m. This means over 30km of ordered ski tracks.</p>","url":"http://www.tourism-cerklje.si/en/What-to-do/Krvavec","poi_type_id":12,"type_name":"Nature","lon":"14.49598622","lat":"46.28497308","visit_duration":300,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/180/thumb_fac5e6ff-e640-428a-8be3-8e952dd514e0.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/180/medium_fac5e6ff-e640-428a-8be3-8e952dd514e0.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/180/fac5e6ff-e640-428a-8be3-8e952dd514e0.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/180/tower_fac5e6ff-e640-428a-8be3-8e952dd514e0.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/180/landscape_fac5e6ff-e640-428a-8be3-8e952dd514e0.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/180/square_fac5e6ff-e640-428a-8be3-8e952dd514e0.jpg","opening_hours":"N/A","details":{"wikipedia":"","facebook":"","twitter":"","youtube":"","instagram":"","pinterest":""},"address":{"address1":"Krvavec","city":"Cerklje na Gorenjskem","post_code":"4207","country":"Slovenia"},"contact":{"name":"","email":"","telephone":"","fax":"","mobile":""},"gallery":[{"image":{"id":180,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/180/thumb_fac5e6ff-e640-428a-8be3-8e952dd514e0.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/180/medium_fac5e6ff-e640-428a-8be3-8e952dd514e0.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/180/fac5e6ff-e640-428a-8be3-8e952dd514e0.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/180/tower_fac5e6ff-e640-428a-8be3-8e952dd514e0.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/180/landscape_fac5e6ff-e640-428a-8be3-8e952dd514e0.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/180/square_fac5e6ff-e640-428a-8be3-8e952dd514e0.jpg","description":""}},{"image":{"id":181,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/181/thumb_2645ae97-8456-49be-874c-03895ea4b7c9.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/181/medium_2645ae97-8456-49be-874c-03895ea4b7c9.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/181/2645ae97-8456-49be-874c-03895ea4b7c9.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/181/tower_2645ae97-8456-49be-874c-03895ea4b7c9.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/181/landscape_2645ae97-8456-49be-874c-03895ea4b7c9.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/181/square_2645ae97-8456-49be-874c-03895ea4b7c9.jpg","description":""}},{"image":{"id":182,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/182/thumb_7a95356b-41c7-4e37-9c19-b4699804d5af.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/182/medium_7a95356b-41c7-4e37-9c19-b4699804d5af.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/182/7a95356b-41c7-4e37-9c19-b4699804d5af.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/182/tower_7a95356b-41c7-4e37-9c19-b4699804d5af.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/182/landscape_7a95356b-41c7-4e37-9c19-b4699804d5af.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/182/square_7a95356b-41c7-4e37-9c19-b4699804d5af.jpg","description":""}},{"image":{"id":183,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/183/thumb_90ba67d6-700f-429a-90b4-6ede06f11c62.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/183/medium_90ba67d6-700f-429a-90b4-6ede06f11c62.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/183/90ba67d6-700f-429a-90b4-6ede06f11c62.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/183/tower_90ba67d6-700f-429a-90b4-6ede06f11c62.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/183/landscape_90ba67d6-700f-429a-90b4-6ede06f11c62.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/183/square_90ba67d6-700f-429a-90b4-6ede06f11c62.jpg","description":""}}]},{"id":107,"priority_index":6,"radius":100,"name":"Lipica Stud Farm","description":"<p>The Lipica Stud Farm is one of the oldest stud farms in the world and the birthplace of the Lipizzaner.

Triglav (»three-headed«) owes its name to its characteristic shape as seen from the south-east side or to the highest Slavic deity who was supposed to have its throne on the top of the mountain. The mountain is a true national symbol and is featured on the national coat of arms and the flag.</p><p>The Triglav National Park extends along the Italian border and close to the Austrian border in the north-west of Slovenia, that is, in the south-eastern section of the Alps. Its territory is nearly identical with that occupied by the Eastern Julian Alps. The park covers 880 square kilometres, or 3% of the territory of Slovenia. The Triglav National Park is among the earliest European parks; the first protection dates back to 1924 when the Alpine Conservation Park was founded.

The natural form of the gorge was impassable, but was soon arranged and opened for public due to the tourist development of Bled which took place already in those days. Due to its natural beauty, Vintgar was classified among the more important tourist sights in Slovenia and the number of visitors increases every year.</p><p><b>Description</b></p><p>The 1.6 km long Vintgar gorge carves its way through the vertical rocks of the Hom and Bort hills and is graced by the Radovna with its waterfalls, pools and rapids. The educational trail leads you over wooden bridges and Žumr’s galleries, and ends with a bridge overlooking the mighty 13 m high Šum waterfall.</p><p>The Vintgar gorge also includes two man-made sights. The single-arch stone bridge of the Bohinj railway, constructed in 1906, which crosses the gorge 33.5 m above the trail, and the dam from which the water is routed to the small Vintgar hydroelectric power plant under the Šum waterfall.</p><p><b>The origin of the name</b></p><p>To one interpretation, the name Vintgar originates from German Weingarten (the vineyards in the nearby Podhom), whilst the other interpretation says that the gorge section reminds on the wine glass. Following the example of Bled's Vintgar such names were also given to other similar gorges in Slovenia (Iški vintgar, Ribnica vintgar above Srednja vas in Bohinj, Bistrica vintgar).</p><p><b>Vegetation</b></p><p>Due to the particular climate and micro relief conditions the Vintgar gorge represents a home for numerous plant species, which differ from the vegetation characteristic for the surrounding area. The amateur botanist and priest Janez Šafer was the first to pay attention to these plant species. His list of plants of the Vintgar gorge was published by Ivan Godec in his article in the \"\"Dom in svet\"\" magazine already in 1899 and later on also in the booklet \"\"Vintgar, Slika iz gorenjske Švice\"\".</p>","url":"http://www.bled.si/en/what-to-see/natural-sights/the-vintgar-gorge","poi_type_id":12,"type_name":"Nature","lon":"14.0844","lat":"46.392","visit_duration":180,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/219/thumb_eb49843b-70ca-48ef-9772-c1af8ce7045d.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/219/medium_eb49843b-70ca-48ef-9772-c1af8ce7045d.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/219/eb49843b-70ca-48ef-9772-c1af8ce7045d.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/219/tower_eb49843b-70ca-48ef-9772-c1af8ce7045d.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/219/landscape_eb49843b-70ca-48ef-9772-c1af8ce7045d.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/219/square_eb49843b-70ca-48ef-9772-c1af8ce7045d.jpg","opening_hours":"N/A","details":{"wikipedia":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vintgar_Gorge","facebook":"","twitter":"","youtube":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oqv3UqHdFmQ","instagram":"","pinterest":""},"address":{"address1":"Podhom 80","city":"Zgornje Gorje","post_code":"4247","country":"Slovenia"},"contact":{"name":" Janko Peterman","email":"jankopeterman@gmail.com","telephone":"","fax":"","mobile":"+386 (0)31 344 053"},"gallery":[{"image":{"id":219,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/219/thumb_eb49843b-70ca-48ef-9772-c1af8ce7045d.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/219/medium_eb49843b-70ca-48ef-9772-c1af8ce7045d.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/219/eb49843b-70ca-48ef-9772-c1af8ce7045d.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/219/tower_eb49843b-70ca-48ef-9772-c1af8ce7045d.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/219/landscape_eb49843b-70ca-48ef-9772-c1af8ce7045d.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/219/square_eb49843b-70ca-48ef-9772-c1af8ce7045d.jpg","description":""}},{"image":{"id":220,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/220/thumb_c6e0de64-2d66-4a8c-b784-3ad93ebbd500.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/220/medium_c6e0de64-2d66-4a8c-b784-3ad93ebbd500.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/220/c6e0de64-2d66-4a8c-b784-3ad93ebbd500.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/220/tower_c6e0de64-2d66-4a8c-b784-3ad93ebbd500.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/220/landscape_c6e0de64-2d66-4a8c-b784-3ad93ebbd500.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/220/square_c6e0de64-2d66-4a8c-b784-3ad93ebbd500.jpg","description":""}},{"image":{"id":221,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/221/thumb_8fdace67-388b-4490-aa64-e0f025fd9c75.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/221/medium_8fdace67-388b-4490-aa64-e0f025fd9c75.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/221/8fdace67-388b-4490-aa64-e0f025fd9c75.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/221/tower_8fdace67-388b-4490-aa64-e0f025fd9c75.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/221/landscape_8fdace67-388b-4490-aa64-e0f025fd9c75.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/221/square_8fdace67-388b-4490-aa64-e0f025fd9c75.jpg","description":""}},{"image":{"id":222,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/222/thumb_6c4567b4-0ca3-4e2c-bcbb-3bc4c07c26e9.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/222/medium_6c4567b4-0ca3-4e2c-bcbb-3bc4c07c26e9.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/222/6c4567b4-0ca3-4e2c-bcbb-3bc4c07c26e9.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/222/tower_6c4567b4-0ca3-4e2c-bcbb-3bc4c07c26e9.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/222/landscape_6c4567b4-0ca3-4e2c-bcbb-3bc4c07c26e9.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/222/square_6c4567b4-0ca3-4e2c-bcbb-3bc4c07c26e9.jpg","description":""}}]},{"id":116,"priority_index":6,"radius":100,"name":"Bled Castle","description":"<p>Perched atop a steep cliff rising 130 metres above the glacial Lake Bled is a symbol of Bled and Slovenia – Bled Castle. The image of the castle forming a dramatic backdrop to the romantic island and the church on it has earned the resort worldwide recognition through the centuries. Castle terraces offer spectacular views of the lake and the island, down the Dežela area with Lesce and Radovljica and over to the mountain ranges of the Karavanke and the Julian Alps.</p><p>It has been over a thousand years since on 10 April 1004 the German king Henry II conferred the estate of Bled located in the province called in Carniola on Bishop Albuin of Brixen and his church. In 1011 Henry II awarded Albuin's successor, Adalberon, the castle on the cliff (castellum Veldes) in a charter in which the castle was first explicitly mentioned. The Bled Castle was the administrative seat of the Brixen estate in the Gorenjsko region. Medieval documents refer to Bled with its German name Veldes.

It was built in the late 15th century by the master builder Peter Bezlaj. It assumed its present appearance between 1717 and 1719, when an annexe designed by Carlo Martinuzzi was added to it by the master builder Gregor Maček Snr. Later the building was alterated several times, the most thoroughly by the architect Svetozar Križaj in 1963.</p><p>The Town Hall façade reflects Venetian architectural influences. The vestibule provides space for a late Gothic plaque with a coat of arms surviving from the original Town Hall building and a 17th century statue of Hercules with a lion, previously a part of the Hercules Fountain which used to stand in the middle of the nearby Stari trg square. In the Town Hall's arched courtyard stands Francesco Robba's Narcissus Fountain (Narcisov vodnjak) from Bokalce Castle (Grad Bokalce). Next to the staircase there is a monument in memory of Ivan Hribar (1851-1941), a famous mayor of Ljubljana.</p><p><b>Exhibitions in the Town Hall</b></p>Ljubljana Town Hall features four exhibition spaces: the Glass Atrium, the Historical Atrium, the Central and Right Atriums.

For it he sacrificed the Ursuline garden, the green area that had provided the largest garden in Ljubljana from the middle of the 17th century on.  The point of departure of the architecture are two thick towers with a triangular profile, set on an elevated platform. They were designed as higher towers, symbolically set on the north wall of the Roman Emona. With the towers, Ravnikar designed a new city gate between Rožnik and Castle Hill. The economic reform in 1965 stopped the impetus. Only 12 basic floors were built and the towers were concluded with different sized crowns layered with copper tin plate. The smaller one became the seat of Ljubljanska banka, the larger one, Iskra. In 1975 the west side of the square was decorated with a monument of revolution and in 1981 with a monument to the politician Edvard Kardelj.</p><p>The trading house which closes off the square by the Ursuline monastery is a piece of quality functionalistic architecture. The architect did not exaggerate in forcing the height of the building. He extended the edifice by the monastery and with that he separated the Baroque part from the new square. The store was connected by a covered basement passageway and garage.</p><p>The square's last large building is the Ivan Cankar Cultural Centre, built and fitted between 1976 and 1984. There are several halls in it; the largest concert hall with about 1500 seats is named after the composer Jakobus Gallus, and a smaller one after the dramatist Anton Tomaž Linhart. There is a smaller gallery in the centre, several exhibition areas and a restaurant. The basic arrangement of the large entrance hall imitates the cathedral in Assisi.</p>\r\n","url":"http://www.slovenia.info/en/Architectural-Heritage/Ljubljana,-Republic-Square-(Trg-republike).htm?arhitekturne_znamenitosti=846&lng=2&redirected=1","poi_type_id":3,"type_name":"Cool & Unique","lon":"14.49986199","lat":"46.05093945","visit_duration":15,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/234/thumb_82f78dde-2999-4dac-9ca2-e1781ca7d167.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/234/medium_82f78dde-2999-4dac-9ca2-e1781ca7d167.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/234/82f78dde-2999-4dac-9ca2-e1781ca7d167.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/234/tower_82f78dde-2999-4dac-9ca2-e1781ca7d167.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/234/landscape_82f78dde-2999-4dac-9ca2-e1781ca7d167.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/234/square_82f78dde-2999-4dac-9ca2-e1781ca7d167.jpg","opening_hours":"N/A","tags":[{"tag_id":9,"name":"Square","category_id":1}],"details":{"wikipedia":"","facebook":"","twitter":"","youtube":"","instagram":"","pinterest":""},"address":{"address1":"Trg republike","city":"Ljubljana","post_code":"1000","country":"Slovenia"},"contact":{"name":"","email":"","telephone":"","fax":"","mobile":""},"gallery":[{"image":{"id":234,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/234/thumb_82f78dde-2999-4dac-9ca2-e1781ca7d167.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/234/medium_82f78dde-2999-4dac-9ca2-e1781ca7d167.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/234/82f78dde-2999-4dac-9ca2-e1781ca7d167.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/234/tower_82f78dde-2999-4dac-9ca2-e1781ca7d167.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/234/landscape_82f78dde-2999-4dac-9ca2-e1781ca7d167.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/234/square_82f78dde-2999-4dac-9ca2-e1781ca7d167.jpg","description":""}},{"image":{"id":235,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/235/thumb_9ae278a9-22f0-4882-956e-39ee85500344.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/235/medium_9ae278a9-22f0-4882-956e-39ee85500344.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/235/9ae278a9-22f0-4882-956e-39ee85500344.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/235/tower_9ae278a9-22f0-4882-956e-39ee85500344.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/235/landscape_9ae278a9-22f0-4882-956e-39ee85500344.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/235/square_9ae278a9-22f0-4882-956e-39ee85500344.jpg","description":""}}]},null,{"id":122,"priority_index":3,"radius":30,"name":"Ljubljana Exhibition And Convention Centre","description":"<p>The Exhibition and Convention Centre (Slovene: Gospodarsko razstavišče) in Ljubljana is a venue for organising domestic and international fairs as well as other events.

The Stanovsko Theatre had a strong German orientation and most of its actors were of German origin. The best seats and boxes were in the permanent possession of Ljubljana’s Nabob and nobility. Such a theatre was certainly not agreeable to progressive Slovenians. However, domestic performances were rare and thus theatre goers had little choice but to visit German plays.</p><p>Then something unthinkable happened. It was on 17 February 1887, at half past midnight: “Fire! Feuer!”</p><p>The fateful fire completely ruined the building – it was razed to the ground. Profound mourning among theatre lovers … many tears… extensive material damage … but … maybe finally now …?</p><p>“Even God himself could not tolerate the injustice that Slovenian people have been subjected to - he has unleashed fire upon the old theatre.”</p><p>In these words, which came straight from the heart of theatre historian, Anton Trstenjak, a ray of hope could be heard. Perhaps at last the time was right for a new theatre, a theatre where the local population would have more rights.</p><p>The foundations for the new theatre were laid soon after the fire – today’s Slovenian National Theatre Drama Ljubljana. On the site of the fire, just few years later, a new building appeared – the so-called Tonhalle.</p><p>The date of 25 October 1891 was marked by music. All over Ljubljana solemn concerts were held, and at the central concert Liszt’s Piano concerto was performed.</p><p>We can only imagine how enchanted the visitors were, admiring the miraculous Great Hall for first time, with its frescoes painted by H. Wettach, an extremely popular artist of the time. Nor did the Small Hall lag behind in its splendour.</p><p>Later, in 1937, the Great Hall was renovated and, in keeping with architect Jože Platner’s plans, a balcony was added. The reconstruction of the undulating rare façade with vases was carried out under Jože Plecnik’s supervision.</p><p>The preparations for the tercentenary of the Slovenian Philharmonic and its predecessors (2001/02), brought about a thorough renovation of the entire building. The restored building was inaugurated on 25 September 2001, while on 8 January 2003, on the three hundredth anniversary of the first documented performances, the newly installed organ resounded in the Great Hall for the first time.</p>","url":"http://www.filharmonija.si/eng","poi_type_id":13,"type_name":"Entertainment","lon":"14.5047196","lat":"46.0495016","visit_duration":60,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/247/thumb_9839595a-3c91-4250-907c-81c5fef973cc.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/247/medium_9839595a-3c91-4250-907c-81c5fef973cc.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/247/9839595a-3c91-4250-907c-81c5fef973cc.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/247/tower_9839595a-3c91-4250-907c-81c5fef973cc.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/247/landscape_9839595a-3c91-4250-907c-81c5fef973cc.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/247/square_9839595a-3c91-4250-907c-81c5fef973cc.jpg","opening_hours":"N/A","tags":[{"tag_id":20,"name":"Concert Hall","category_id":13}],"details":{"wikipedia":"","facebook":"","twitter":"","youtube":"","instagram":"","pinterest":""},"address":{"address1":"Kongresni trg 10","city":"Ljubljana","post_code":"1000","country":"Slovenia"},"contact":{"name":"","email":"info@filharmonija.si","telephone":"+386 1 2410 800","fax":"+386 1 2410 900","mobile":""},"gallery":[{"image":{"id":247,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/247/thumb_9839595a-3c91-4250-907c-81c5fef973cc.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/247/medium_9839595a-3c91-4250-907c-81c5fef973cc.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/247/9839595a-3c91-4250-907c-81c5fef973cc.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/247/tower_9839595a-3c91-4250-907c-81c5fef973cc.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/247/landscape_9839595a-3c91-4250-907c-81c5fef973cc.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/247/square_9839595a-3c91-4250-907c-81c5fef973cc.jpg","description":""}},{"image":{"id":248,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/248/thumb_cf5a139f-b15f-4e08-a09b-e3145e82d27c.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/248/medium_cf5a139f-b15f-4e08-a09b-e3145e82d27c.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/248/cf5a139f-b15f-4e08-a09b-e3145e82d27c.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/248/tower_cf5a139f-b15f-4e08-a09b-e3145e82d27c.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/248/landscape_cf5a139f-b15f-4e08-a09b-e3145e82d27c.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/248/square_cf5a139f-b15f-4e08-a09b-e3145e82d27c.jpg","description":""}},{"image":{"id":249,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/249/thumb_ea572523-0ee7-4e39-b5f8-83fe074cfecc.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/249/medium_ea572523-0ee7-4e39-b5f8-83fe074cfecc.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/249/ea572523-0ee7-4e39-b5f8-83fe074cfecc.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/249/tower_ea572523-0ee7-4e39-b5f8-83fe074cfecc.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/249/landscape_ea572523-0ee7-4e39-b5f8-83fe074cfecc.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/249/square_ea572523-0ee7-4e39-b5f8-83fe074cfecc.jpg","description":""}},{"image":{"id":250,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/250/thumb_eb260611-a4ef-4e97-adc3-d60cd339d69c.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/250/medium_eb260611-a4ef-4e97-adc3-d60cd339d69c.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/250/eb260611-a4ef-4e97-adc3-d60cd339d69c.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/250/tower_eb260611-a4ef-4e97-adc3-d60cd339d69c.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/250/landscape_eb260611-a4ef-4e97-adc3-d60cd339d69c.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/250/square_eb260611-a4ef-4e97-adc3-d60cd339d69c.jpg","description":""}}]},{"id":124,"priority_index":3,"radius":30,"name":"The Slovenian Academy Of Sciences And Arts ","description":"<p>The Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts (by short SASA), founded in 1938, is the supreme national institution of sciences and arts.

The terminal building (T1) was extended with a new upper level added to it and completely renovated; the floor that was added on top of the departure lounge added an additional 4,000 m2 (43,000 sq ft), and four jetways have also been installed so that passengers have easier access to the terminal and aircraft. A walkway to the second terminal building (T2) will be added after the T2 terminal is approved. With completion of the work on T1, the airport gained extra floor area, which in the short term will ensure the separation of Schengen and non-Schengen traffic.</p>","url":"http://www.lju-airport.si/en/Main","poi_type_id":6,"type_name":"Public Transport","lon":"14.45515255","lat":"46.23101997","visit_duration":90,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/281/thumb_c8ebcdf0-4092-4856-b471-ae3bdbdf63b9.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/281/medium_c8ebcdf0-4092-4856-b471-ae3bdbdf63b9.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/281/c8ebcdf0-4092-4856-b471-ae3bdbdf63b9.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/281/tower_c8ebcdf0-4092-4856-b471-ae3bdbdf63b9.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/281/landscape_c8ebcdf0-4092-4856-b471-ae3bdbdf63b9.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/281/square_c8ebcdf0-4092-4856-b471-ae3bdbdf63b9.jpg","opening_hours":"N/A","details":{"wikipedia":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ljubljana_Jo%C5%BEe_Pu%C4%8Dnik_Airport","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/Letalisce-Jozeta-Pucnika-525628570828582/?fref=ts","twitter":"","youtube":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRVxPhL_wD_P1JAKVS3d-xw","instagram":"","pinterest":""},"address":{"address1":"Zgornji Brnik 130a","city":"Brnik","post_code":"4210","country":"Slovenia"},"contact":{"name":"","email":"info@lju-airport.si","telephone":" +386 (0)4 20 61 981","fax":"","mobile":""},"gallery":[{"image":{"id":281,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/281/thumb_c8ebcdf0-4092-4856-b471-ae3bdbdf63b9.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/281/medium_c8ebcdf0-4092-4856-b471-ae3bdbdf63b9.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/281/c8ebcdf0-4092-4856-b471-ae3bdbdf63b9.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/281/tower_c8ebcdf0-4092-4856-b471-ae3bdbdf63b9.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/281/landscape_c8ebcdf0-4092-4856-b471-ae3bdbdf63b9.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/281/square_c8ebcdf0-4092-4856-b471-ae3bdbdf63b9.jpg","description":""}},{"image":{"id":282,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/282/thumb_4202d727-3e6e-41d2-a67f-fbed87e42782.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/282/medium_4202d727-3e6e-41d2-a67f-fbed87e42782.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/282/4202d727-3e6e-41d2-a67f-fbed87e42782.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/282/tower_4202d727-3e6e-41d2-a67f-fbed87e42782.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/282/landscape_4202d727-3e6e-41d2-a67f-fbed87e42782.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/282/square_4202d727-3e6e-41d2-a67f-fbed87e42782.jpg","description":""}},{"image":{"id":283,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/283/thumb_19cfd756-0a2a-4169-93c4-fc0cf3c27a15.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/283/medium_19cfd756-0a2a-4169-93c4-fc0cf3c27a15.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/283/19cfd756-0a2a-4169-93c4-fc0cf3c27a15.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/283/tower_19cfd756-0a2a-4169-93c4-fc0cf3c27a15.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/283/landscape_19cfd756-0a2a-4169-93c4-fc0cf3c27a15.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/283/square_19cfd756-0a2a-4169-93c4-fc0cf3c27a15.jpg","description":""}},{"image":{"id":284,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/284/thumb_0c545327-c722-4178-9eac-cd7addd11e3b.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/284/medium_0c545327-c722-4178-9eac-cd7addd11e3b.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/284/0c545327-c722-4178-9eac-cd7addd11e3b.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/284/tower_0c545327-c722-4178-9eac-cd7addd11e3b.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/284/landscape_0c545327-c722-4178-9eac-cd7addd11e3b.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/284/square_0c545327-c722-4178-9eac-cd7addd11e3b.jpg","description":""}}]},{"id":134,"priority_index":5,"radius":20,"name":"City Museum Of Ljubljana","description":"<p<The City Museum of Ljubljana is situated in Auersperg Palace, which in itself is an architectural monument, and holds Ljubljana’s cultural heritage of several millennia. This ranges from the 4,500-year-old prehistoric pile dwelling settlement to the present-day charming capital of Slovenia, from the ancient town to the emergence of the modern economic, political, administrative and creative centre.</p><p><b>About Auersperg Palace</b></p><p>Auersperg Palace and the location where the Museum is situated represent a significant part of Ljubljana’s cultural heritage.</p><p>In the Roman period, this was where port suburbs of the Roman Emona stretched, as evidenced by the Roman road preserved in the Museum’s basement.</p><p>The Palace was rebuilt in 1654 by the Counts of Auersperg, who were one of the most prominent noble houses of Carniola, from their own house and two additional houses in just four years. The three tracts encompassed a newly arranged courtyard in the centre of which a stone fountain and a linden tree were situated. The Counts mainly lived here during winter, whilst they spent the summer at Turjak Castle. Their prominence in the life of the city is also evidenced by the fact that the Austrian Emperor Joseph II paid them a visit.</p><p>The Palace was soon subject to the first Baroque alterations, and in 1824 master builder Francesco Cocconi provided its front with a late Baroque façade, emphasising it by means of a Classicist portal. Auersperg Palace was badly affected by the 1895 earthquake. In 1927, the Palace was sold to the state.</p><p>In mid-1935, the Palace was bought by the Municipality of Ljubljana and allocated to the City Museum for the purpose of “collecting all objects relating to the history of Ljubljana, i.e. with regard to both Ljubljana’s role in spiritual and national terms and to the development of present-day Ljubljana”. The refurbishment of interior spaces was undertaken in April 1937. That same year saw the opening of the first museum collection which provided an insight into the middle-class residential culture from the late Middle Ages to the first half of the 19th century.</p><p>After World War Two, Auersperg Palace was also home to the Slovanska knjižnica library, the Municipal Archives of Ljubljana, the Education and Culture Board of the Municipal People’s Administration, the cloakrooms of the Ljubljana City Theatre, and several private residents.</p><p>The 1990s in the City Museum were particularly influenced by the Towards a Friendly Museum project in which the Museum started to open up to the public and its building started to be renovated. As a result, a new floor area of 1,000 m2 was acquired, the building was provided with a basement and, consequently, extensive archaeological research was undertaken and significant findings were recorded. The project was concluded with the Curve architecture competition project, undertaken as a comprehensive renovation of the premises in terms of construction, seismic safety and function. The internationally awarded project designed by the architects Špela Videčnik and Rok Oman succeeded in approaching the Museum’s mission to the highest degree possible, i.e. to make Auersperg Palace available to public programmes and, along with that, to harmonise the ancient palace with the Museum’s dynamic activity, thereby reaching the widest possible audience as well as other users.</p><p><b>About the Museum</b></p><p>The mission of the City Museum of Ljubljana is to record, document, conserve, study and present the movable cultural heritage as regards the Ljubljana region. Its collection comprises over 200,000 museum objects accounting for several millennia of the Ljubljana region’s heritage. Special mention is to be made of two findings, i.e. the world’s oldest wooden wheel with a wooden axle and a wooden point around 40,000 years old.</p><p>You can visit the City Museum of Ljubljana to view our interactive and thematically designed permanent exhibition about the history of Ljubljana and its inhabitants, or you can visit us in order to see the current temporary exhibitions.</p><p>The Museum functions as a meeting point for visitors to various events intended for adults, families or school groups. Lectures, round-table discussions, projections, guided tours, workshops, training courses, concerts and other events are designed to meet the various needs and wishes of our visitors.</b>","url":"http://www.mgml.si/en/city-museum-of-ljubljana-377/","poi_type_id":2,"type_name":"Art & Museums","lon":"14.50393913","lat":"46.04693841","visit_duration":60,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/285/thumb_127ca141-4156-4c18-b3f9-5e14d64747ab.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/285/medium_127ca141-4156-4c18-b3f9-5e14d64747ab.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/285/127ca141-4156-4c18-b3f9-5e14d64747ab.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/285/tower_127ca141-4156-4c18-b3f9-5e14d64747ab.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/285/landscape_127ca141-4156-4c18-b3f9-5e14d64747ab.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/285/square_127ca141-4156-4c18-b3f9-5e14d64747ab.jpg","opening_hours":"N/A","details":{"wikipedia":"","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Muzej-in-galerije-mesta-Ljubljane/123191654959","twitter":"","youtube":"","instagram":"","pinterest":""},"address":{"address1":"Gosposka 15","city":"Ljubljana","post_code":"1000","country":"Slovenia"},"contact":{"name":"","email":"prijava@mgml.si","telephone":"01 2412 500","fax":"","mobile":""},"gallery":[{"image":{"id":285,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/285/thumb_127ca141-4156-4c18-b3f9-5e14d64747ab.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/285/medium_127ca141-4156-4c18-b3f9-5e14d64747ab.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/285/127ca141-4156-4c18-b3f9-5e14d64747ab.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/285/tower_127ca141-4156-4c18-b3f9-5e14d64747ab.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/285/landscape_127ca141-4156-4c18-b3f9-5e14d64747ab.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/285/square_127ca141-4156-4c18-b3f9-5e14d64747ab.jpg","description":""}},{"image":{"id":286,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/286/thumb_096be863-a8f6-4b8b-93ea-55c459dd5050.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/286/medium_096be863-a8f6-4b8b-93ea-55c459dd5050.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/286/096be863-a8f6-4b8b-93ea-55c459dd5050.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/286/tower_096be863-a8f6-4b8b-93ea-55c459dd5050.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/286/landscape_096be863-a8f6-4b8b-93ea-55c459dd5050.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/286/square_096be863-a8f6-4b8b-93ea-55c459dd5050.jpg","description":""}}]},{"id":135,"priority_index":5,"radius":20,"name":"City Art Gallery Of Ljubljana","description":"<p><b>History of the City Art Gallery of Ljubljana</b></p><p>The building at Mestni trg 5 was built in the early 16th century by Count Lanthieri.

It remained in use as a commercial building – until more recently there was a fur shop – up until 1963, when it was turned into an art gallery by way of a decree adopted by the Ljubljana Centre municipal people's committee. The building’s renovation according to plans designed by the architect Boris Kobe was managed by the Institute for the Regulation of Old Ljubljana.</p><p>After the Jakopič Pavilion started to be demolished in December 1961, the Pavilion’s directorate was left without business premises and an exhibition space. In November 1962, the Jakopič Pavilion was renamed the City Art Gallery whereby the expert public’s concerns as to the Jakopič Pavilion’s legal succession and the related construction of a new pavilion were allayed.</p><p>The new exhibition rooms at Mestni trg 5 were formally inaugurated as the exhibition premises of the City Art Gallery in October 1963. Apart from modernised exhibition halls (renovated in 1990 and 1991) and the renovated attic, the Gallery also acquired a café on the ground floor and in 2009 a reading room, where its visitors and art lovers are provided with a wide range of daily newspapers, catalogues as well as modern art magazines from Slovenian and foreign publishers.</p><p>After 50 years of engaging in exhibition activities and hosting numerous projects, the Gallery only started to form its own collection in the 1990s. In 1996, upon the acquisition of new premises at Mestni trg 4, the first exhibition of the permanent collection of the City Art Gallery of Ljubljana was staged. The collection which in 2009 became an integral part of the MGML collection comprises 190 works on paper by 70 Slovenian and six foreign artists. Since 1995, i.e. the year of commencing the collection activity, works by all prominent exponents of Slovenian art of the 20th century have been acquired, evidencing progress in the artists’ creative directions. As the collection policy provided for the acquisition of works by artists belonging to diverse periods and artistic styles, the collection’s span is therefore extensive – ranging from traditional, realistic depictions of the material world to fantastic and abstract representations. Owing to its heterogeneity in terms of ideas and the variety of technical approaches, the collection provides excellent opportunities for study.\r\nIn 2002, one section of the exhibition activity was moved to new premises, i.e. the Permanent Collection Gallery at Cankarjevo nabrežje 11/I. It was here that presentations of artists of different artistic styles mainly creating on paper were being held until December 2010.</p><p>The Bežigrad Gallery – one of Ljubljana’s smaller art galleries – has been active within the framework of the City Art Gallery since 1996. In addition, the Bežigrad Gallery II was opened in 2002. In 2009, at the initiative of the Municipality of Ljubljana, the City Art Gallery of Ljubljana including the Bežigrad Gallery was merged with the City Museum of Ljubljana to form an institution now called the Museum and Galleries of Ljubljana. In 2010, new premises in the Tobačna 001 Cultural Centre were acquired. In March 2011, a new exhibiting programme was launched in the 001 Gallery.</p><p><b>Exhibitions of the City Art Gallery of Ljubljana</b></p><p>During the 50 years of uninterrupted operation, numerous exhibitions were put on, with the Gallery’s programme changing in accordance with cultural needs and the growing exhibition opportunities in Ljubljana. The emphasis has been on a well-balanced relationship between exhibitions dealing with domestic and international artistic production, and between group and solo exhibitions, with a special focus on retrospective and overview exhibitions of renowned artists and monographic exhibitions of younger artists.</p><p>When faced with concrete exhibition-related problems, the Gallery has always provided its expert potential and invited both local and foreign experts to participate in addressing certain issues pertaining to individual areas and art genres. Moreover, our guests’ position on art could then be affirmed by selected exhibitions.</p><p>By organising retrospective and overview exhibitions, the Gallery has put on display many works of art by many of the most renowned Slovenian artists from various generations whilst, by exhibiting the current art production, the Gallery has attempted to present a specific excerpt from individual artists’ oeuvres. Special attention has always been paid to presenting younger artists and, especially, new generations of artists. The Gallery has always aimed to identify the most outstanding art phenomena in Slovenia.</p><p>Since 2009, the Gallery's exhibition programme has included the organisation of two overview or retrospective exhibitions of Slovenian artists a year, group presentations of conteporary Slovenian and international artists who, by using different media, show their integration into current artistic and social contexts and society at large. In triennial periods, extensive thematic historical exhibitions are staged whose aim is to present the development of a certain artistic element, style, theme or content.</p>","url":"http://www.mgml.si/en/city-art-gallery/","poi_type_id":2,"type_name":"Art & Museums","lon":"14.50653157","lat":"46.04947905","visit_duration":60,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/287/thumb_18c06a68-7f76-4268-b373-2caf42853b77.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/287/medium_18c06a68-7f76-4268-b373-2caf42853b77.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/287/18c06a68-7f76-4268-b373-2caf42853b77.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/287/tower_18c06a68-7f76-4268-b373-2caf42853b77.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/287/landscape_18c06a68-7f76-4268-b373-2caf42853b77.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/287/square_18c06a68-7f76-4268-b373-2caf42853b77.jpg","opening_hours":"N/A","tags":[{"tag_id":19,"name":"Gallery","category_id":2}],"details":{"wikipedia":"","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/mestna.galerija.ljubljana/","twitter":"","youtube":"","instagram":"","pinterest":""},"address":{"address1":"Mestni trg 5","city":"Ljubljana","post_code":"1000","country":"Slovenia"},"contact":{"name":"Alenka Premrov","email":"mestna.galerija@mgml.si ","telephone":"+386 (0) 1 2411770","fax":"","mobile":""},"gallery":[{"image":{"id":287,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/287/thumb_18c06a68-7f76-4268-b373-2caf42853b77.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/287/medium_18c06a68-7f76-4268-b373-2caf42853b77.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/287/18c06a68-7f76-4268-b373-2caf42853b77.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/287/tower_18c06a68-7f76-4268-b373-2caf42853b77.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/287/landscape_18c06a68-7f76-4268-b373-2caf42853b77.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/287/square_18c06a68-7f76-4268-b373-2caf42853b77.jpg","description":""}},{"image":{"id":288,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/288/thumb_4cb6858e-4689-4939-ad88-a229e52d6763.jpeg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/288/medium_4cb6858e-4689-4939-ad88-a229e52d6763.jpeg","image_large":"/images/image/link/288/4cb6858e-4689-4939-ad88-a229e52d6763.jpeg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/288/tower_4cb6858e-4689-4939-ad88-a229e52d6763.jpeg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/288/landscape_4cb6858e-4689-4939-ad88-a229e52d6763.jpeg","image_square":"/images/image/link/288/square_4cb6858e-4689-4939-ad88-a229e52d6763.jpeg","description":""}}]},{"id":136,"priority_index":4,"radius":20,"name":"Jakopič Gallery","description":"<p>Established in 1988, the Jakopič Gallery is situated in the underground of the Slovenska cesta 9 in the centre of Ljubljana.

The architect Jože Plečnik moved to a single-storey house at 4 Karunova street in Ljubljana’s Trnovo district in 1921. In the 1923-25 period the house was expanded westward by a cylindrical annex. After having bought the neighbouring house in 1929, Plečnik arranged a winter garden to the south. It is here that the master lived his isolated and unconventional life in privacy until his old age.</p><p>After Plečnik's death in 1957, his nephew Karel Matkovič moved to the house and started to sort out the master's extensive legacy consisting mainly of designs and correspondence. Thanks to Matkovič, Plečnik’s valuable legacy remained in the house almost intact. When Matkovič died in 1970, the heirs decided to sell the house including the legacy to the City of Ljubljana. Two years later, the Architecture Museum of Ljubljana was set up in the building.</p><p>On 1 April 1972, the Architectural Museum of Ljubljana based at Plečnik house opened its doors to the public. It remained there until 1992 when the majority of its departments moved to renovated premises at Fužine Castle which were allocated with the Museum’s basic tasks.</p><p>Plečnik house was arranged and opened to the public in 1974 when, due to the sensitivity of the paper materials, the collection of Plečnik's sketches and designs was moved from the museal section of the house to temporary storerooms at 4 Karunova street where the materials could be examined, arranged and studied.</p><p>The house contains rooms displaying the artist's valuable original furniture and personal objects, a collection of clay, plaster and wooden models of various projects, Plečnik's personal library and his drawing utensils. Today, visitors can see the entrance hall, the corridor, the kitchen, the bedroom with the bathroom, the small reception room, the spiral staircase, the master's studio on the upper floor and the winter garden. Due to the exceptional circumstances and intimacy of the site, the house can only be visited as part of guided tours. These are adapted to various age groups which must not contain more than seven people.</p><p>In 2001, a reception area for visitors was arranged on the ground floor of the house at 6 Karunova street, with the collection storage facilities being situated on the first floor. The collection comprises the architect’s extremely valuable original drawings and designs arranged by theme and project and in chronological order. An extensive share of the materials is accounted for by various projects for Ljubljana which nevertheless often remained on paper. Especially important are Plečnik’s early drawings from the Viennese and Prague periods, as well as designs for many Slovenian towns – regulations, renovations and proposals for monuments. Plečnik’s correspondence is similarly extensive as the architect occasionally corresponded with as many as 400 contemporaries, including some of the most renowned:\r\nOtto Wagner, Tomaš G. Masaryk, Ivan Hribar and many more. Also of great value is the collection of photographs containing Plečnik’s rare portraits and documentary photos of various projects during construction and upon completion. The storerooms also contain thesis projects of Plečnik’s students which were moved by the artist himself to his studio during World War Two. Special mention must be made of the diploma papers of the first two graduates from the Department of Architecture within the Technical Faculty in Ljubljana from 1924:\r\nDušan Grabrijan and France Tomažič, who were followed by Vinko Glanz, Edvard Ravnikar, Edvard Mihevc and others. The collection also comprises various wooden, plaster and clay models and an archive of “Ognjišče akademikov arhitektov” (the Academy of Architecture Collection).</p><p>Since mid-2010, Plečnik house has been managed by the Museum and Galleries of Ljubljana.

The Initiative to establish a national gallery was undertaken by the aristocratic polymath and correspondent Peter Radics and the mayor of Ljubljana, Dr Ivan Hribar, followed by the Christian Art Society which, in 1907, compiled a collection of older Slovenian art. In short, throughout the decades there had been kept alive the irrepressible desire of the Slovenians to have their own arts institution − a desire that was ultimately fulfilled in 1925, with the acquisition of the Narodni dom (National Hall). Likewise important was the regular annual acquisition of works of art: with the legacy from the Strahl will of 1929, it may be said that the National Gallery acquired a considerable fund of works by domestic and European painters, which in 1930 was first exhibited to the public. In 1927 the commissioned casts from the Louvre were brought from Paris to Ljubljana and magnificently installed in the \"Slovenian Louvre\". The fund from the donation by Dr Fran Windischer − who was at the same time a patron, then from 1929 also President of the National Gallery Society − was a contribution of exceptional value to the art collection; the Windischer Fund − the first legacy in the history of the institution − is still today the foundation of the gallery's collection.</p><p>Thus from the first dreams of the initiators, and with the high cultural awareness of all Slovenians, the National Gallery developed into one of the most eminent cultural and artistic institutions. Already on 22 June 1933, the Gallery had arranged the ceremonial opening of the expanded permanent collection of Slovenian art. From all parts of the homeland and from abroad there arrived congratulatory telegrams and greetings-cards to mark the great event. The Gallery had achieved professional success and was beginning to enjoy a great reputation among the Slovene public.</p><p>Likewise, at this time, we must not overlook the exceptional selfless dedication of the first directors of the National Gallery of Slovenia. The first to take up the post of Director of the Gallery was Ivan Zorman; until 1950 he successfully led and carried out all the renovation works in the Narodni dom Palace, while at the same time shaping and expanding the permanent collection, always with the aid of the art-history experts, who gave their devoted support to the Gallery (particularly Dr Izidor Cankar, Dr France Mesesnel and Dr France Stele). The second director was Dr Karel Dobida, who headed the Gallery until September 1964. He promoted the systematic introduction of annual exhibitions, and by so doing filled in a gap in the art-history profession. The first monograph exhibitions, on Ivan Grohar and the brothers Šubic, were followed in 1951 by the great monograph exhibition Fortunat Bergant, in 1957 Kremser-Schmidt, in 1959 the exhibition Mediaeval Frescoes in Slovene Lands, in 1961 The Baroque in Slovene Lands, and in 1960 and 1964 the exhibitions of Foreign Old Masters. In 1956, Dr Emilijan Cevc issued the first publication in the collection Vodnik po umetnostnih zbirkah Narodne galerije (Umetnost srednjega veka na Slovenskem) (Guide to the art collections of the National Gallery (Medieval art in Slovenian land)), and in 1958 appeared the Vodnik po Narodni galeriji (Guide to the National Gallery) with a text by Dr Karl Dobida, presenting the history of the Gallery and a brief survey of the permanent collection.</p><p>On 1 July 1946, the National Gallery was taken under the charge of the People's Republic of Slovenia and became a state gallery with firmer economic and organizational foundations. Despite the pressure on space caused by the increasing number of exhibitions, and the ever greater overstocking of the depots, the Gallery tirelessly continued with its established programme.</p><p>When in 1951 the Moderna galerija (Museum of Modern Art) opened its permanent collection, supplemented by the fund from the National Gallery of Slovenia, both institutions were being directed by Dr Karl Dobida, and the exhibitions there were also being set up by curators from the Gallery.</p><p>Numerous further exhibitions were to follow up to the 50th anniversary of the National Gallery of Slovenia − at that time directed by Dr Anica Cevc − and each individually marked an important milestone on research into the Slovenian artistic past. The grand jubilee, in 1968, was celebrated by opening of the exhibition Umetnost XVII. stoletja na Slovenskem (Art of the XVII. Century in Slovenian Lands), which comprised painting, sculpture, illuminated manuscripts, tombstones, reliefs, graphics and artisanal art. One of the most important exhibitions in the art-history profession was Gotska plastika na Slovenskem (Gothic Sculpture in Slovenian lands), in 1973, under the direction of Dr Emilijan Cevc; the exhibition presented the artistic position of the Slovenian provinces in the Middle Ages.</p><p>Another special turning-point was the exhibition Kitajsko slikarstvo (Chinese Painting) in 1988, which was up till then the most visited exhibition at the National Gallery of Slovenia. The year 1988 was also the one in which the Gallery, by taking over the building of the Klub delegatov (Delegates Club), moved forward into the new period of architectural development. Preparations were begun for construction of the extension, and in 1991 the initial construction works for the new building by the architect Edvard Ravnikar were effectively begun. At the same time, in summer 1991, on account of the military aggression against Slovenia, all the staff of the National Gallery of Slovenia had to evacuate the works of art with the greatest urgency and transfer them to safe storage in the deepest basement spaces of the gallery.</p><p>When Dr Anica Cevc, the long-time Director, retired in autumn 1991, she was succeeded by Dr Andrej Smrekar.</p><p>The collection of “foreign” old masters again saw the light of day with the exhibitions Foreign Masters from 14th to 20th Century (1983), European Still Lifes from Slovenian Collections (1989) and European Painters from Slovenian Collections (1993). The world-renowned expert Frederico Zeri and Dr Ksenija Rozman authored the latter exhibition. It laid the foundations for the opening of the Permanent Collection of European Painters in the New Wing of the Gallery in 1997.</p><p>The Narodni dom Palace was declared a cultural monument in 1993. In 1995, the society called Friends of the National Gallery of Slovenia was founded, realising an idea that went back the very beginning of the National Gallery Society in 1918. Amongst the projects of all-Slovenian significance, one which stands out in particular, is the great exhibition Gotika v Sloveniji (Gothic Art in Slovenia), which the Gallery presented in 1995 in co-operation with the Faculty of Arts, University of Ljubljana. The exhibition comprised, on a theoretical basis, all genres of art and the entire Slovene ethnic territory, and involved numerous experts from Slovenia and abroad for the critical treatment of the material. The project at the same time opened the doors of the new gallery building, thus making its landmark in the history of the National Gallery of Slovenia. With its new spaces, the gallery enriched its physical possibilities for performing the basic tasks established as far back as in 1918, i.e.: to safeguard the heritage of the Slovenian people, and to transmit it to the public at the highest possible professional level. Diverse series of exhibitions is proof of ambitious and thoughtful programming. Among the large scale exhibitions we should mention the outstanding exhibition Zakladi slovenskih cerkva (Treasures of Slovenian Churches) (1999) and the monograph survey presentation Življenje in delo baročnega slikarja Valentina Metzingerja (The Life and Work of the Baroque Painter Valentin Metzinger), by the author and long-standing Director of Gallery, Dr Anica Cevc, who prepared the exhibition in the year 2000.</p><p>For the National Gallery of Slovenia, perhaps the most crucially important year was 2001, when construction works were completed on the new Entrance Hall, designed by Sadar Vuga Architects. This meant that the National Gallery had opened itself to new tasks and new forms of transmitting the cultural heritage in a world of changing relations between the viewing and the museum institutions, which − as for all national galleries worldwide − will be determined and shaped only by time.</p><p>Noteworthy was the exhibition of prints by Marjan Pogačnik, who donated his collection to the Gallery in 2002. That year, the Gallery programme was enriched by exhibitions dedicated to Biedermaier painter Jožef Tominc and to Baroque painting in Gorizia. The latter represented the first comprehensive art-history study of an entire crown land in Slovenia. Also based on field studies were the exhibitions on Zorzi Ventura Brajković (2003) and on Master HGG, Brajković’s contemporary from central Slovenia and Croatia (2004); 2005 saw the exhibition on Almanach, a younger and mysterious painter, who was presented within the context of his contemporaries. That same year the Gallery highlighted neoclassical painter Franc Kavčič/Caucig. His pictures for the Auersperg Palace in Vienna followed in two years and the themes of Antiquity in 2010. Exhibition of manuscripts from the Žiče Charterhouse in 2006 was unique for its rare and fragile artefacts. Portraits of Bishops of Ljubljana, resulting from a large-scale research project, followed in 2007.</p><p>The 2008 relocation of the Robba Fountain to the Gallery drew much attention. The long-planned undertaking was carried out during the tenure of Dr Barbara Jaki, the Director of the National Gallery of Slovenia since 2005. The occasion was marked by a symposium on the Robba Fountain and Robba’s oeuvre in 2010.</p><p>Slovenian Impressionists and Their Time 1890–1920 was a landmark exhibition and research project of the Gallery. Realized in 2008, the grand-scale exhibition saw a rapturous reception by the public. It initiated the exhibition of Slovenian Impressionists in the Parisian Petit Palais in 2013. In 2009, a travelling exhibition Works of Art from Prekmurje was mounted, one of rare regional overviews of art styles. The same year saw two exhibitions featuring works on paper, First Prints and Drawing in Slovenia I. The oeuvre of a sculptor Aljoz Gangl followed in 2010. New acquisitions of the National Gallery of Slovenia between 2001 and 2010 were presented in detail in 2012. In 2014 and 2015, paintings and sculpture of the Government Art Collection were showcased to the public. The Gallery took over the custody of the Collection from the Executive Council of the Socialist Republic of Slovenia in 1986.</p><p>Long past its due, the renovation of the Narodni dom Palace and the expansion of the Gallery started in 2012. The project was concluded with the inauguration of the new Permanent Collection of Art of Slovenia on 27 January 2016. At the grand opening, the bronze portrait of Dr Anica Cevc (1926–2011), a longtime Director of the Gallery, was unveiled. The sculpture is the work of Mirsad Begić.</p><p>The complex of the National Gallery of Slovenia is made of three integrated wings. It encompasses 12,670 m2, with exhibition spaces covering 3,955 m2.

A permanent exhibition of other key sciences needed for a railway to operate is located in the nearby ancillary building of the rotunda.\r\nIn the first room, one can experience the atmosphere in stationmaster’s office at a small railway station in the final years of the Austria-Hungary monarchy, equipped with everything needed for traffic management and ticket sales.</p><p>The second room contains nine types of railway tracks from various periods and railway administrations, reflecting various rulers on the Slovenian territory. Small railway vehicles with trolleys standing on them were once used by line supervisors and maintainers. Manual tools and aids bear witness to how difficult maintenance used to be. The development of the railway network in Slovenia is presented with seven maps from different periods, alongside which old railway boundary stones remind us of the past.</p><p>One museum room is devoted to basic devices for the transmission of messages, like telegraphs, telephones and teleprinters, as well as apparatuses of higher levels like short-wave and FM radio stations, devices for registration of telephone conversations, station public address systems, as well as system of railway clocks.</p><p>A special space is set aside for railway uniforms, the \"garment of honour\", as designed over time. Here, certain work equipment of railway workers is also gathered, including the especially charming manual railway lanterns.</p><p>In the area of signalling and safety devices, the museum contains a representative collection of electromechanical and electrodynamic block devices and other devices – both dating back to the oldest and more recent history.

Gallery","description":"<p>The 2007 renovation of the premises of the former Križanke Cultural and Information Centre gave rise to the Vžigalica Gallery.\r\nThe space has not only undergone a transformation in terms of physical renovation, image and name, but mainly as regards its programme and organisation. The Vžigalica Gallery has risen to prominence as a venue for varied projects pertaining to contemporary visual, audio-visual, performance and other art practices. So far, the co-operation with non-governmental and other organisations active in the field of culture has yielded results and offered new perspectives on both sides, which is why this co-operation is continuing.</p><p>During the time of its existence, the Vžigalica Gallery has hosted diverse exhibitions which were either part of larger projects and festivals or independent presentations of major names of world art and young artists, even artists in residence. Apart from that, the Gallery has also been engaged in both domestic and international projects whose production was specially adjusted to the venue.</p><p>The Vžigalica Gallery retains its basic concept of a smaller yet extremely flexible art gallery in the very centre of Ljubljana. Its task will remain to encourage various reactions of both culture and art to the idea of urban culture and, at the same time, to contribute to defining this phenomenon.</p><p>By making public invitations for projects we aim to encourage the non-governmental sector, artists and other organisations to respond to the phenomena occurring in the urban cultural space in which we live, and to place them in a wider context of contemporary culture and art. The broader context means both an expanded view in the geographical sense, i.e. familiarity with the macrocosmos of international production and the culture of contemporary society at large; as well as the broad-mindedness of the artist’s or curator’s attitude to a certain visual work of art, installation, audio-visual object or performance practice. Our intention is to continue to study the concept of urbanity, i.e. to identify the artistic attributes of the town, the challenges posed by urban culture, and to find out how to address them when a broad range of starting points is taken into account: artistic, educational, scientific, creative, visual, aural, virtual, historical, social and many more.</p><p>The Gallery’s objective is to act as a laboratory for new ideas, creative formulas and different attitudes which invariably arise from high-quality contemporary artistic production.</p><p>The projects presented are compiled bearing in mind the fact that the Vžigalica Gallery is the most flexible part of Ljubljana’s central museal and gallery institution whose fundamental values as regards presentations of both the heritage and contemporary art practices reflect accessibility, quality production, instructiveness, professional competence, creativity and co-operation.</p>","url":"http://www.mgml.si/en/vzigalica-gallery/","poi_type_id":2,"type_name":"Art &

Castle","description":"<p>Situated on an islet in the middle of the Krka River, the castle building, together with its park, paints one of the most picturesque images in the country and is a prominent cultural and natural monument. The first historical reference to the castle dates as far back as 1252, when it was part of the Lower Carniolan Freising estate, administered by the de Werde nobles, also known as islet knights. Over the centuries that followed the castle underwent architectural and ownership changes, passing from one noble family to another. Today the castle, restored to its original Gothic and Renaissance splendour, houses one of the most outstanding hotels in Slovenia – the Otočec Castle Hotel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The origins of the Otočec Castle are veiled in mystery since not much is known about who built it or when it was built. Its primary location is also mysterious for supposedly it used to be situated on the right bank of the Krka River. One of its later owners ordered a part of the estate on the right side of the castle to be dug out in order to increase its protection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Home to the de Werde noblemen in the 13th century, who were also known as the Knights of Otočec, this castle is the only one in Slovenia that sits on a river island. The magnificent castle on the river Krka was for centuries both a stronghold and a gracious home to numerous noble families. Its most prominent inhabitants, apart from the Knights of Otočec, were the Villanders nobles of Tyrol, captain of Žumberak Uskoks Ivan Lenkovič, and the noble Janez Sonce, who is also the central character in a narrative by Ivan Tavčar. Before World War II the castle was owned by the House of Marghieri de Commadona.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Medieval structure of the castle has changed in time, yet some of the architectural details were preserved and cannot be missed out on. One of the most important ones is the Renaissance portal dating back to the 16th century decorated with two marble medallions bearing maiden profiles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the beginning of World War II the castle was seized by the Italians and used as a fortress. In 1942, it was burnt by the Partisans and only ruins remained of the two bridges. Castle’s restoration began in 1952 with the restoration of the roof and lasted for six years, also with the help of international work brigades. In 1959, the first restaurant was opened in the restored castle. Over the next few decades the castle changed its appearance until it was restored to its original Gothic and Renaissance splendour as it houses one of the most outstanding hotels in Slovenia – the Otočec Castle Hotel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Otočec Castle is in addition to being the only castle situated on a river islet in Slovenia also the only one in the region of Dolenjska that was burnt down during the war and then restored.</p>","url":"http://www.grad-otocec.com/en/us/home/","poi_type_id":3,"type_name":"Cool & Unique","lon":"15.23525492","lat":"45.83800576","visit_duration":100,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/393/thumb_2cb38bf5-d5a5-46e3-a9ef-1efdcc2b6424.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/393/medium_2cb38bf5-d5a5-46e3-a9ef-1efdcc2b6424.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/393/2cb38bf5-d5a5-46e3-a9ef-1efdcc2b6424.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/393/tower_2cb38bf5-d5a5-46e3-a9ef-1efdcc2b6424.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/393/landscape_2cb38bf5-d5a5-46e3-a9ef-1efdcc2b6424.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/393/square_2cb38bf5-d5a5-46e3-a9ef-1efdcc2b6424.jpg","opening_hours":"N/A","tags":[{"tag_id":12,"name":"Castle","category_id":1},{"tag_id":16,"name":"Restaurant","category_id":4},{"tag_id":40,"name":"Golf","category_id":1}],"details":{"wikipedia":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oto%C4%8Dec_Castle","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/GradOtocec","twitter":"","youtube":"","instagram":"https://www.instagram.com/castleotocec/","pinterest":""},"address":{"address1":"Grajska cesta 2","city":"Otočec ob Krki ","post_code":"8222","country":"Slovenia"},"contact":{"name":"","email":"booking@terme-krka.si","telephone":"+386 8 20 50 310","fax":"","mobile":""},"gallery":[{"image":{"id":393,"sort_index":1,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/393/thumb_2cb38bf5-d5a5-46e3-a9ef-1efdcc2b6424.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/393/medium_2cb38bf5-d5a5-46e3-a9ef-1efdcc2b6424.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/393/2cb38bf5-d5a5-46e3-a9ef-1efdcc2b6424.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/393/tower_2cb38bf5-d5a5-46e3-a9ef-1efdcc2b6424.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/393/landscape_2cb38bf5-d5a5-46e3-a9ef-1efdcc2b6424.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/393/square_2cb38bf5-d5a5-46e3-a9ef-1efdcc2b6424.jpg","description":""}},{"image":{"id":394,"sort_index":2,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/394/thumb_c0d8d211-b388-44fa-ba0c-3e75ad662b19.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/394/medium_c0d8d211-b388-44fa-ba0c-3e75ad662b19.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/394/c0d8d211-b388-44fa-ba0c-3e75ad662b19.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/394/tower_c0d8d211-b388-44fa-ba0c-3e75ad662b19.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/394/landscape_c0d8d211-b388-44fa-ba0c-3e75ad662b19.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/394/square_c0d8d211-b388-44fa-ba0c-3e75ad662b19.jpg","description":""}},{"image":{"id":395,"sort_index":3,"image_thumb":"/images/image/link/395/thumb_1fc8ef5e-0091-4d96-a16d-6701b6b72c7e.jpg","image_medium":"/images/image/link/395/medium_1fc8ef5e-0091-4d96-a16d-6701b6b72c7e.jpg","image_large":"/images/image/link/395/1fc8ef5e-0091-4d96-a16d-6701b6b72c7e.jpg","image_tower":"/images/image/link/395/tower_1fc8ef5e-0091-4d96-a16d-6701b6b72c7e.jpg","image_landscape":"/images/image/link/395/landscape_1fc8ef5e-0091-4d96-a16d-6701b6b72c7e.jpg","image_square":"/images/image/link/395/square_1fc8ef5e-0091-4d96-a16d-6701b6b72c7e.jpg","description":""}}]},{"id":175,"priority_index":5,"radius":40,"name":"The Museum Of Dolenjska","description":"<p>The first idea of a museum that would collect material on the history of Novo mesto and Dolenjska was born in 1865, when the town celebrated its 500th anniversary. After several years of efforts by the Museum Society (founded in 1941) – an association of Dolenjska intellectuals, who started to systematically collect museum material – the long-awaited museum was finally founded in 1950, exactly 85 years after the first initiative. On 1 June 1950, the museum was handed over to the District People’s Committee Novo mesto by a decision of the People’s Committee of the Ljubljana government. Since then, that day has been considered the birthday of the Museum of Dolenjska. Every year, it is publicly celebrated with an Open Doors Day featuring diverse activities all day long, and – since 1996 – with the traditional exhibition From the depots of the Museum of Dolenjska.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first permanent exhibitions of the Museum of Dolenjska were opened in 1953 in the Križatija building, which has housed the museum since 1951. A general regional museum, the Museum of Dolenjska expanded and in the mid-1980s, it acquired its present form by including the remote facilities of Jakac House and Kočevski rog. Initially one building, the museum complex now comprises four buildings, not counting the remote facilities of Jakac House and Kočevski rog. Today, the museum comprises eight permanent exhibitions, five curatorial departments, an education department, and a restoration workshop for archaeological artefacts.
